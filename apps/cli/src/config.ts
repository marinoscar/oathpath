// =============================================================================
// Credential and server-URL storage  (issue #143, epic #110)
// =============================================================================
//
// Three places a credential can come from, in this precedence order:
//
//   1. `APPCTL_TOKEN` / `APPCTL_SERVER_URL` in the environment
//   2. `~/.appctl/config.json`
//   3. nowhere — which is a first-class outcome, not an error to stumble into
//
// WHY THE ENVIRONMENT WINS. It is the only thing that makes the CLI usable in
// CI, and CI is the case with the least room to improvise: there is no
// browser to complete a device flow in, no TTY to prompt on, and no writable
// (or persistent) home directory to have logged in to earlier. Secrets arrive
// as environment variables because that is what every CI system provides, so
// the environment must be able to fully supply a credential with no file
// present at all. Putting the file first would mean a developer's stale
// personal token silently beating the pipeline's service token on a
// self-hosted runner — the kind of bug that only ever reproduces on the one
// machine nobody can debug on.
//
// WHY A `0600` FILE AND NOT AN OS KEYCHAIN. A keychain is genuinely better on
// a desktop and unavailable everywhere else this runs: it needs a native
// module (so a compiler, or a prebuilt for every platform), it has nothing to
// talk to in a container, and it fails over SSH where no session bus exists —
// which is precisely where a CLI gets used. A fallback would be required
// regardless, and it is the fallback that would end up carrying the traffic.
// See `writeConfigFile` for how `0600` is actually guaranteed, which is the
// part that is easy to get subtly, invisibly wrong.
//
// WHY NOT ENCRYPT THE FILE. The key would have to sit next to the ciphertext,
// which is not encryption, it is obfuscation with a maintenance cost. Issue
// #108 encrypts *server-side* secrets because a server has somewhere else to
// keep a key; a CLI on a laptop does not.
//
// THE TOKEN IS NEVER PRINTED BY ANYTHING IN THIS FILE. `describeConfig()` is
// the only display path and it cannot return the token — see `maskToken`.
// =============================================================================

/**
 * Persist the config, replacing whatever was there.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW `0600` IS ACTUALLY GUARANTEED — the part with a trap in it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious implementation is `writeFileSync(path, json, { mode: 0o600 })`,
 * and it is WRONG in a way that never shows up in a passing test.
 *
 * `mode` is the mode passed to `open(2)`, and `open(2)` APPLIES IT ONLY WHEN
 * IT CREATES THE FILE. Writing over an existing `config.json` ignores `mode`
 * entirely and leaves whatever permissions the file already had. So the first
 * login on a clean machine produces a correct `0600` file and every test
 * asserting the mode passes — while a user whose config was ever created by
 * something else (an older build without the mode, a `cp` from a dotfiles
 * repo, an editor that rewrote it, a restore from an archive that dropped
 * modes) keeps a world-readable token forever, and re-running `login` does not
 * fix it because that is exactly the path that ignores the mode.
 *
 * The other obvious implementation — write, then `chmod` — closes that gap but
 * opens a window: between the write and the chmod the token is on disk under
 * the process umask, typically `0644`. On a shared machine that window is all
 * an attacker needs, and it is reopened on every single login. #143 asks for
 * the mode AT CREATION for precisely this reason.
 *
 * So: create a BRAND NEW file with `flag: 'wx'` (O_CREAT|O_EXCL — the open
 * fails rather than reusing anything, which makes `mode` unconditionally
 * apply), then `rename(2)` it over the target. Rename moves the inode, so the
 * destination ends up with the new file's `0600` no matter what the old one
 * had, and it is atomic within a filesystem — a crash or a full disk mid-write
 * leaves the previous config intact instead of a truncated file that reads as
 * corrupt. The temp file is created in the SAME DIRECTORY because `rename`
 * across filesystems fails with EXDEV, and `~` can easily be a different mount
 * from the system temp directory.
 *
 * ON UMASK: `mode` is masked by the process umask, and a umask can only CLEAR
 * permission bits, never set them. So `0o600 & ~umask` is at most `0o600` for
 * every possible umask — the file can end up more restrictive (a `0o077`
 * umask yields `0o600`, a `0o277` umask yields `0o400`) but never more
 * permissive. That one-directional property is what makes "no window where it
 * is world-readable" a guarantee rather than a hope.
