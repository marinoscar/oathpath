//
// Routing and nothing else. Each screen is mounted only while it is the current
// route, which is not merely a rendering detail — it is what keeps the keyboard
// unambiguous. Every screen registers its own `useInput`, and ink delivers each
// keystroke to EVERY mounted handler; screens kept alive off-screen would go on
// consuming keys, so `n` on the invoke screen would also fire the menu's
// shortcut. Conditional mounting means exactly one handler exists per key.
//
// It also means leaving a screen unmounts it, which is what fires the effect
// cleanups that abort in-flight requests and poll loops. That is the difference
// between pressing Esc during a login and the process quietly continuing to
// poll for the remaining fourteen minutes.
//
// THERE IS NO ROUTE HISTORY. Every screen returns to the menu and nowhere else,
// so "back" has one meaning everywhere and Esc never lands somewhere a user has
// to work out.

 * than its own content collapses, and every `<Box>` in the tree starts
 * competing for columns that do not exist. Rather than render a smear, the app
 * says so in one line and waits — a RESIZE re-renders this component, so
 * widening the terminal brings the UI back with no keypress and no restart.
 * #145 asks for degrade, not crash; this is the last rung of the ladder that
 * starts in `Frame`.
