// =============================================================================
//
// `update` has to answer three questions before it does anything: is anything
// installed, where, and at which commit. `status` needs the same. This file is
// where the answer lives.
//
// IT IS NOT IN ~/.oathpath/config.json, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE.
// `writeConfigFile` copies an ALLOW-LIST of fields and drops everything else on
// every write (see config.ts). Deploy state placed there would survive until
// the next `oathpath login` and then vanish, turning a working deployment into
// one the CLI believes was never installed. Its own file, next to the
// deployment it describes, also means the state travels with the server rather
// than with whichever operator's home directory happened to run the install.
