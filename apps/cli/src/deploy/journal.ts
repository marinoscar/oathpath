// =============================================================================
// The run journal  (issue #173, epic #168)
// =============================================================================
//
// "Keep a detailed log for troubleshooting" is a headline requirement of this
// epic, and the whole point is that the log OUTLIVES THE TERMINAL SESSION. An
// install runs over SSH, takes minutes, and the person diagnosing it later is
// usually not the person who ran it.
//
// Two files per run, because they have two different readers:
//
//   <command>-<timestamp>.log    a human reading it over SSH
//   <command>-<timestamp>.jsonl  a program, and `oathpath deploy status --json`
//
// REDACTION IS THE SECURITY-CRITICAL PART AND IT IS STRUCTURAL. These logs are
// written to be pasted into bug reports; that is their purpose. So every
// string written goes through a redactor seeded with the secret VALUES the
// wizard collected. Nothing here is trusted to remember to redact at the call
// site, because the one call site that forgets is the one that leaks.
//
// A JOURNAL NEVER THROWS INTO THE DEPLOY. A log directory that cannot be
// written is a nuisance; a deployment aborted because of one is a bug. Every
// write is guarded and degrades to a single warning on stderr.
// =============================================================================
