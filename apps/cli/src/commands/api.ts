// =============================================================================
// `oathpath api <method> <path>`  (issue #144, epic #110)
// =============================================================================
//
// ONE COMMAND FOR THE WHOLE API, and the reason is architectural rather than
// lazy. This repository is a BASELINE: downstream applications delete
// `/api/allowlist`, add `/api/invoices`, and rename half of what is left. A
// CLI with a hand-written subcommand per resource would be obsolete in every
// fork on the day it was forked, and every new endpoint would need matching
// CLI work forever. A generic invoker is the only shape that stays correct
// through that — it works against endpoints that do not exist yet.
//
// #110 records the two alternatives and why they lost: typed subcommands
// (friendlier, and wrong for a template) and generating commands from the
// published OpenAPI document (genuinely attractive, and a code-generation
// pipeline plus a schema-drift problem — a project of its own). The generic
// command is the foundation under either of them.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CONTRACT THIS COMMAND MAKES WITH A SHELL
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   stdout : the response body. Nothing else. Ever.
//   stderr : status line, spinner, warnings, errors.
//   exit 0 : if and only if the server answered 2xx.
//
// All three are load-bearing and all three fail silently when broken. A status
// line on stdout breaks `--raw | jq` for every consumer at once. An exit 0 on
// a 403 turns a broken deploy into a green pipeline, and nobody finds out
// until much later.
//
// The exit codes are not computed here: the command THROWS, `program.ts`
// catches, and `exitCodeFor` (errors.ts) maps ApiError → 3 (or 5 for a 401),
// NetworkError → 4, UsageError → 2. The message printed is `err.message`,
// which ApiError has already built as `<status>: <the server's own sentence>`
// — so a missing permission arrives as `403: Missing permission users:read`
// and not as `Request failed`. That is the entire point of errors.ts, and this
// command's job is to not get in its way.
// =============================================================================

/**
 * Methods this command will send.
 *
 * AN ALLOW-LIST, not a passthrough, because #144 asks for a typo to be a clear
 * local error rather than a confusing remote one. `oathpath api GTE /api/users`
 * sent verbatim gets a 404 or a 405 from the server, and a 404 reads as "that
 * endpoint does not exist" — sending the user to check the path, which was
 * correct all along. Rejecting it here names the actual mistake.
 *
 * The set is HTTP's own, not this API's: HEAD and OPTIONS are here because
 * probing an endpoint's existence and its allowed methods is a legitimate
 * thing to do with a generic client, and excluding them would push someone to
 * curl. TRACE and CONNECT are excluded — no application server should honour
 * them and both are proxy-level operations.
 *
 * EXPORTED FOR THE INK TUI (#145), which offers these as a pick-list on its
 * endpoint-invoker screen rather than making the user type one. A second
 * hard-coded list there would be the classic way for the two interfaces to
 * drift — the TUI would keep offering a method the command had stopped
 * accepting, and the mismatch would only ever be noticed by a user.

/**
 * Write the response body to stdout.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT GETS PRINTED: `response.body`, IN BOTH MODES. THE UNWRAPPED
 * `response.data` IS NEVER PRINTED. This is the one decision in #144 with a
 * real argument on both sides, so here is the whole of it.
 *
 * The API's TransformInterceptor wraps a handler's return value as
 * `{ data, meta: { timestamp } }` — but it PASSES THROUGH anything that
 * already carries a `data` key. A paginated endpoint returns
 * `{ data: [...], pagination: { total, page, pageSize } }` and is therefore
 * NEVER WRAPPED. `unwrapEnvelope` cannot tell those two cases apart (nothing
 * can, from the outside — they are the same shape), so unwrapping
 * `GET /api/users` yields the bare array and SILENTLY DISCARDS THE PAGE COUNT.
 *
 * THE CASE FOR PRINTING `data`: it is what a human wants. One less level of
 * nesting, no `meta.timestamp` noise on every single call.
 *
 * THE CASE FOR PRINTING `body`, which wins, on two grounds:
 *
 *   1. THE TWO MODES MUST AGREE. `--raw` must emit the server's own bytes —
 *      a script piping into `jq` wants the truth, not a client-side
 *      interpretation, and `ApiResponse.body` exists to carry exactly that.
 *      If the default mode unwrapped and `--raw` did not, then a user who
 *      explored an endpoint interactively and then wrote a `jq` filter against
 *      what they saw would have written it against a shape that does not
 *      exist in the pipe. They would debug the filter. The CLI would have lied
 *      to them, in the one mode where being trustworthy is the whole feature.
 *
 *   2. UNWRAPPING IS LOSSY AND INCONSISTENT — see the pagination case above.
 *      A generic API command that cannot show the total on `GET /api/users` is
 *      broken for the endpoint from #144's own examples. The envelope is cheap
 *      noise; the dropped page count is expensive silence. Between a mode that
 *      is slightly verbose and a mode that is quietly wrong, take verbose.
 *
 * `unwrapEnvelope` and `ApiResponse.data` remain right for TYPED callers —
 * `device-login.ts` asks for a `CurrentUser` and means it. They are wrong for
 * a passthrough, which is what this command is.

 *
 * THE `/api` PREFIX IS OPTIONAL AND STRIPPED WHEN PRESENT. This is the subtle

 * appends it, because the API sets it as a global prefix in main.ts), so

 * the endpoint, the docs, and their permissions, none of which are the
 * problem. Since #144's own examples all write the prefix, and the docs and
 * Swagger show it too, both forms must work. The match requires a segment
 * boundary, so a real endpoint at `/apikeys` is untouched.
 *
 * The inline query string is SPLIT AND MERGED rather than left in the path,
 * because `buildUrl` would otherwise append `?page=2` to a path that already
 * contained a `?` and produce a URL with two of them — which is not an error
