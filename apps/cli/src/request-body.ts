// =============================================================================
// Resolving `--data` into a JSON value  (issue #144, epic #110)
// =============================================================================
//
// `--data` accepts three forms, following curl's convention because it is the
// one every user of a generic HTTP CLI already has in their fingers:
//
//   --data '{"email":"a@b.com"}'   the literal text
//   --data @body.json              the contents of a file
//   --data -                       everything on stdin  (also `@-`)
//
// WHY THE FILE AND STDIN FORMS ARE NOT A CONVENIENCE. #144 gives the reason
// directly: bodies do not belong in shell history, and a POST body is the
// common case for that. `oathpath api POST /api/allowlist --data '{"email":...}'`
// is fine; the same command carrying an API key, a person's details, or a
// 40KB settings document is a credential-and-PII leak into `~/.bash_history`,
// into `ps` output visible to every other user on the box, and into the CI log
// of anything that echoes its commands. There is also a hard ceiling — ARG_MAX
// — that turns a large body into `Argument list too long`, which reads like a
// bug in the CLI rather than a limit of the shell.
//
// WHY THE PAYLOAD IS PARSED HERE RATHER THAN HANDED STRAIGHT TO THE CLIENT.
// A malformed body must be a LOCAL error. Sent as-is, a missing brace becomes
// a 400 from a Zod validator complaining about a field the user did believe
// they set — which sends them auditing their data model when the actual
// problem is a shell quoting mistake three characters long. Parsing first
// turns that into "your JSON is invalid at position 23", which is the whole
// diagnosis. It also means the exit code is USAGE (2) rather than API (3),
// which is the honest classification: the server never saw this request.
//
// The parsed value is then RE-SERIALISED by ApiClient rather than the original
// text being forwarded. That is deliberate: it guarantees the bytes on the
// wire are valid JSON with the client's own Content-Type, and it means a body
// with a UTF-8 BOM or trailing newline from an editor cannot reach the server
// as something Fastify's parser rejects.
// =============================================================================
