// =============================================================================
// Terminal output: stream discipline, colour detection, JSON rendering
// (issue #144, epic #110)
// =============================================================================
//
// This module exists so that the ONE rule the `api` command lives or dies by
// is implemented once instead of being remembered at every call site:
//
//   STDOUT CARRIES THE RESPONSE BODY AND NOTHING ELSE.
//   Status lines, spinners, warnings and errors go to STDERR.
//
// That rule is not a style preference. `oathpath api GET /api/users --raw | jq`
// and `oathpath api GET /api/users --raw > users.json` are the two things the
// command is FOR (#144), and a single stray byte on stdout — a spinner frame,
// an ANSI reset sequence, a "200 OK" line — makes `jq` exit with a parse error
// and makes the saved file unusable. The failure is total, not partial, and it
// is invisible until somebody's script breaks.
//
// The colour logic below is hand-rolled rather than delegated to `chalk` or
// `picocolors` on purpose. This package's dependency list is `commander` and
// nothing else (#140), and a package whose whole job is carrying a bearer
// token around should not grow transitive dependencies to make numbers yellow.
// The rules that actually matter — NO_COLOR, FORCE_COLOR, TERM=dumb, "is it
// even a terminal" — are about twenty lines.
// =============================================================================

 * Should output be coloured?

 *
 *   1. `--no-color`. An explicit flag about THIS invocation always wins.
 *   2. `NO_COLOR` (https://no-color.org). Present and non-empty disables
 *      colour for every tool that honours it; ignoring it is how a CLI ends
 *      up escaping-sequence-spamming somebody's accessibility setup.
 *   3. `FORCE_COLOR`. The escape hatch for the case a TTY check cannot detect:
 *      a CI runner that renders ANSI in its web log viewer while handing the
 *      process a pipe. `FORCE_COLOR=0` is the conventional "off" value.
 *   4. `TERM=dumb`. A terminal that has told us it cannot render sequences.
 *   5. Is it a TTY at all — the default, and the case that catches every pipe
 *      and every redirect without anyone having to configure anything.
 *
 * NOTE the caller's other obligation: `--raw` must not even ASK this question.
 * Raw output is machine input, and colour in it is corruption regardless of
 * how loudly FORCE_COLOR was set. `commands/api.ts` hard-codes `false` there
 * rather than routing the decision through here, so no environment variable on
 * any machine can break a pipeline.

 * (a JSON blob stored in a `system_settings` JSONB column, say, or an error
 * `details` field) gets mis-highlighted, and mis-highlighting looks exactly

 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES THIS HAS TO GET RIGHT, all of which are silent when wrong:
 *
 *   1. It writes to STDERR ONLY. A spinner on stdout is the textbook way to
 *      corrupt `--raw` (#144 says so explicitly), and it would do so
 *      INTERMITTENTLY — only on requests slow enough to trigger it — which is
 *      the worst kind of bug to be handed in a report.
 *
 *   2. It is disabled whenever stderr is not a TTY. Carriage returns do not
 *      overwrite anything in a CI log; they accumulate into one enormous line
 *      that some viewers refuse to render at all. `commands/login.ts` carries
 *      the same rule for its polling status.
 *
 *   3. Both timers are `unref()`d. A referenced interval keeps the event loop
 *      alive, so a CLI that had already computed its exit code would sit there
 *      spinning instead of exiting. `unref` means the process ends the moment
 *      the real work is done, whatever the timer thinks.
 *
 * The returned stopper is idempotent and MUST be called from a `finally`, so a
 * thrown ApiError cannot leave a half-drawn frame in front of the error
 * message.
