// =============================================================================
// Command wiring  (issue #140, epic #110)
// =============================================================================
//
// Commands: `login` (#142/#143), `config` (#143) and `api` (#144), plus the
// no-argument ink TUI (#145). `--help` and `--version` remain the proof that
// the bin resolves, that the ESM build runs, and — the part that is easy to get
// wrong and expensive to discover later — that a failed invocation exits
// non-zero.
//
// SEPARATE FROM cli.ts, which is the executable. This module only ever RETURNS
// an exit code; it never calls `process.exit`, and it runs nothing on import.
// That is what lets a test call `run([...])` and assert on the number, instead
// of having to spawn a child process to find out whether the CLI would have
// failed.
//
// Two rules this file exists to enforce for every command added after it:
//
//   1. NOTHING BUT COMMAND OUTPUT GOES TO STDOUT. Errors, progress and prompts
//      go to stderr, because #144 promises that `--raw` output pipes into `jq`
//      unchanged, and one stray status line on stdout breaks that for every
//      consumer at once.
//
//   2. FAILURE IS NON-ZERO, ALWAYS. A CLI that prints an error and exits 0
//      passes CI, and the pipeline stays green while nothing works.
// =============================================================================
