/**
 * Restore the document's scroll position when a list-like page is returned to.
 *
 * Issue #91, epic #90. Below `sm` the settings hub becomes an iOS-style
 * drill-down list, and drill-down lives or dies on this detail: returning from
 * a detail page to a long hub and landing back at the top — forcing the user
 * to re-find their place every single time — is exactly what makes a
 * drill-down feel like a broken web page rather than a native settings app.
 * Both hubs (#93 admin, #96 user) call this, so it is written as a generic
 * hook rather than folded into either page.
 *
 * Three facts about this app decide the implementation:
 *
 *  1. **The scroller is the DOCUMENT.** `Layout.tsx`'s shell sets
 *     `minHeight: 100dvh` and `<main>` is not an overflow container — the whole
 *     page scrolls — so the offset lives in `window.scrollY`, not in some
 *     element's `scrollTop`. If a future layout ever makes `<main>` scroll,
 *     this hook silently saves 0 forever and must be revisited with it.
 *  2. **The page fully unmounts** on drill-down, so the offset cannot live in
 *     component state, a ref, or a context — all three die with the tree.
 *     `sessionStorage` outlives the remount (and a reload) while staying
 *     scoped to the tab, which is the right lifetime for a scroll offset:
 *     `localStorage` would restore a position from a session last week.
 *  3. **Content renders asynchronously.** At mount the document is usually far
 *     shorter than the saved offset, so a single `scrollTo` silently CLAMPS to
 *     the current bottom and the user lands somewhere arbitrary. This is why
 *     SPAs get restoration wrong by default, and why
 *     `history.scrollRestoration` does not help: the browser cannot know the
 *     eventual height of content that has not been fetched yet. The only fix
 *     is to retry until the target is actually reachable.
 *
 * @param key      Stable identifier for the scrolled surface, e.g.
 *                 `'admin-settings-hub'`. Namespaced into the storage key so
 *                 two surfaces never share an offset.
 * @param options  `enabled` (default `true`); `false` makes the hook a no-op,
 *                 for a page that should only restore in one of its modes —
 *                 e.g. a hub that restores in its compact drill-down treatment
 *                 but not in the card grid. The hook is still CALLED
 *                 unconditionally, per the rules of hooks; the flag is read
 *                 inside the effect.
