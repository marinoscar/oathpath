/**
 * A fetch-based Server-Sent Events client.
 *
 * Issue #127, epic #109.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL — `EventSource` CANNOT SEND AN AUTHORIZATION HEADER
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * `GET /api/notifications/stream` is guarded by the ordinary bearer `@Auth()`,
 * exactly like every other endpoint. The native `EventSource` constructor takes
 * a URL and `withCredentials`, and NOTHING ELSE — there is no headers argument
 * and no way to add one. So the browser's built-in SSE client cannot
 * authenticate against that route.
 *
 * The two ways out, and why this is the one taken:
 *
 *   1. REJECTED — `?token=…` on the stream URL. The API refused this
 *      deliberately (see the long note on `NotificationsController.stream`), and
 *      the refusal is right: a URL query string is written verbatim into the
 *      nginx access log, kept in browser history, and forwarded in `Referer` to
 *      any third party the page later touches. That turns a live bearer
 *      credential into something replayable out of a log file retained for
 *      months and readable by people who are not supposed to hold sessions.
 *      Cheap transport is not worth credentials in logs.
 *
 *   2. CHOSEN — `fetch()` with a real `Authorization` header, reading
 *      `response.body` as a `ReadableStream` and parsing the SSE framing here.
 *      `fetch` takes arbitrary headers; the cost is that everything
 *      `EventSource` does for free — framing, reconnection, backoff — has to be
 *      written, which is what the rest of this file is.
 *
 * WHY HAND-ROLLED RATHER THAN A DEPENDENCY (`@microsoft/fetch-event-source`).
 * This worktree cannot take a new dependency, and on inspection it does not
 * need one: the whole client is the parser below plus a retry loop, both of
 * which are small, fully testable without a network, and — unlike a
 * dependency — able to reuse this app's own `ApiService` token and refresh
 * machinery directly rather than through a callback shim. A library would also
 * bring its own opinions about 401 handling, which is precisely the part that
 * has to match `services/api.ts` exactly.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * WHAT THIS CLIENT DOES NOT DO, AND MUST NOT BE MADE TO DO
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE DELIVERY. Anything the server publishes while this
 * connection is down is GONE: the API holds no buffer, honours no
 * `Last-Event-ID`, and has no replay log (`NotificationStreamService`'s header
 * says so in as many words). This client therefore reports every (re)connection
 * through `onOpen`, and ITS CALLER IS REQUIRED TO REFETCH on that signal. Do
 * not add replay here; the `notifications` table is the source of truth and one
 * indexed query after a gap is strictly more reliable than any cursor built on
 * top of a stream.
 *
 * `lastEventId` is parsed and tracked because the SSE grammar has the field and
 * a parser that silently dropped it would be wrong — but it is NOT sent back as
 * `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect, because the server does not implement it and a
 * header that looks like resumption but resumes nothing is worse than no header
 * at all.

// `POST /api/civics/questions/:id/explain` is the opposite kind of stream. It
// is one answer to one question, delivered in pieces, and it is over when the
// terminal frame arrives. Three properties of `connectSse` are actively wrong
// for it, which is why this is a second function and NOT a `method` option
// bolted onto the first:
//
//  1. **IT MUST NOT RECONNECT.** Every attempt spends the learner's own AI key.
//     A backoff loop over a POST that costs money turns one failed explanation
//     into an unbounded charge on somebody's card, silently, in a background
//     tab. There is no retry here at all — a caller who wants another
//     explanation asks for one, deliberately, by pressing a button.
//  2. **IT MUST CARRY A BODY AND A METHOD.** `EventSource` cannot, and neither
//     can `connectSse`, which is built around a GET whose only variable is the
//     `Authorization` header.
//  3. **IT ENDS.** `connectSse` treats end-of-stream as a fault to recover
//     from; here it is the normal, expected finish, and the promise resolving
//     is how the caller learns the stream is done.
//
// What it DOES share is the reason `services/sse.ts` exists at all: the native
// `EventSource` cannot send an `Authorization` header, a token in the query
// string would land in access logs and browser history, and the SSE framing
// therefore has to be parsed here. It reuses {@link SseParser} verbatim rather
// than re-deriving the grammar — a second framing implementation is a second
// place for the CR/LF and mid-field split bugs to live.
