/**
 * The navigation rail — tablet and desktop chrome for the app's destinations.
 *
 * Issue #55, epic #51. This REPLACES `Sidebar`'s temporary drawer at `sm` and
 * up. The drawer it replaces was `variant="temporary"` at EVERY breakpoint,
 * which is why it needed hardcoded AppBar-height offsets, `disablePortal`, and
 * a `setTimeout(() => navigate(path), 0)` to let the close animation finish
 * before the route changed. A rail is always visible, so navigating costs ZERO
 * taps where a drawer costs one before navigation can even begin — and with no
 * drawer to close, that navigate-after-close race cannot occur at all.
 *
 * TWO TREATMENTS, ONE COMPONENT
 * -----------------------------
 *   medium  (sm–lg)  →  collapsed, 56px, icon over a short caption
 *   expanded (≥ lg)  →  expanded, 220px, labelled rows + a collapse toggle
 *
 * Both treatments share one FOOT: the destinations the model marks `pinned`
 * (Console today) sit below a divider at the bottom of the rail, above the
 * collapse toggle, rather than inline with the library destinations — see the
 * render and `config/destinations.ts` (#105).
 *
 * A desktop user may collapse the rail to the tablet treatment; the choice
 * persists in `user_settings.navigation.railCollapsed`.
 *
 * The medium tier is ALWAYS collapsed regardless of that preference. Honouring
 * a stale `railCollapsed: false` below `lg` would render a 220px rail on a
 * 600px screen — a third of the viewport spent on chrome.
 *
 * CONSOLE MODE — and where it deliberately stops
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Issue #94, epic #90. On any `/admin/*` route the rail swaps its CONTENTS for
 * the admin sections declared in `config/adminSections.tsx`, promoting
 * `SettingsHubPage`'s permission-gated cards from a page into navigation. Every
 * settings-to-settings move used to have to route back through the hub landing
 * page and pick another card, while 220px of chrome showed three rows that were
 * not the ones the user needed.
 *
 * It swaps ONLY WHEN EXPANDED, and that asymmetry is deliberate — do not
 * "fix" it. A 56px column cannot host labelled group headers, and a stack of
 * near-identical unlabelled admin icons is worse than no swap at all. So at the
 * medium tier, and whenever a desktop user has collapsed the rail, the rail
 * keeps LIBRARY navigation with `Console` marked active and `SettingsHubPage`
 * IS the admin navigation. That is exactly the reasoning epic #90 applies to
 * the phone (no rail at all, so the hub is a drill-down), applied to the other
 * size class that has no room for group headers either — and it preserves the
 * guarantee that the user is always one click out of the admin surface.
 *
 * Console mode also invents no admin IA of its own: it reads the same
 * `ADMIN_SECTIONS` array through the same `visibleSettingsSections` gate as the
 * hub and the AppBar title resolver, so the three cannot disagree about what
 * exists or who may see it.
