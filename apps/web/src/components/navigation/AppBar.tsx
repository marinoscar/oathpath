 * is the matched surface's own hub path, and a boolean "some registry claimed
 * this path" cannot answer that. The `??` chain in issue #95 computes the
 * title correctly and loses exactly the fact the back button needs.
 *
 * Order is admin-first, matching #95's snippet. Nothing currently depends on
 * it — `/admin/settings` does not sit under `/settings`, so at most one entry
 * can ever claim a path — but keeping the declared order identical means the
 * day a surface IS nested under another, this file and the issue still agree.
 *
 * Adding a third settings surface is adding a row here. There is deliberately
 * no per-surface branch anywhere below.

 * moment they arrived any other way — a deep link from an email, a
 * `<Navigate>` redirect off a legacy `/admin/users` URL (#92), an OAuth
 * callback landing them here — and then the entry BEFORE this page is another
 * site, so "back" silently means "leave the app". Structural up is the same
 * arrow every time, which is also what makes it safe to sit next to the OS
 * back gesture rather than duplicate it: the gesture stays history, this stays
 * hierarchy, and the user has both.
 *
 * The hub's own parent is `/` rather than nothing: the hub is the top of the
 * settings hierarchy, so one more level up leaves settings entirely. Below
 * `sm` the bottom bar is already showing library destinations, so this is a
 * shortcut rather than the only exit — but a back arrow that does nothing on
 * one screen of the drill-down is worse than no back arrow at all.
 *
 * NO PERMISSION GATE HERE, unlike the hub and the Console rail, and
 * deliberately: `settingsPageTitle` falls back to the surface's hub title for
 * any path it cannot attribute to a card, so filtering the registry first
 * would relabel a page rather than hide it — the route guard, not the header,
 * is what denies an unpermitted page, and by the time this bar renders the
 * guard has already had its say. Naming a page the user is looking at leaks
 * nothing the page itself does not.

 *
 * Issue #95, epic #90 adds the DRILL-DOWN treatment: below `sm` on a settings
 * route the wordmark is replaced by a back arrow and the resolved page title.
 * The mobile reference screenshot is back arrow + "Settings" + avatar, and
 * both halves of that swap are load-bearing on a phone — without the arrow
 * there is no way up a level from the header, and the wordmark spends the
 * bar's whole width saying something the user already knows instead of saying
 * which of a dozen settings pages they are on.
 *
 * At `sm` and up the wordmark and toggle come back UNCHANGED, on settings
 * routes too: the rail is mounted there and already shows where the user is,
 * so replacing the wordmark would cost the app's identity and buy nothing.

            The toggle is dropped in the drill-down because it is REDUNDANT

            inside the very surface the bar is heading into. The bell is

            centre anywhere in the app, and a user who cannot see that something
            arrived while they happen to be on a settings screen has simply lost
            the feature for the duration.

            The width still works out. The drill-down carries [back][title][bell]
            [avatar] — three icon buttons, the same count as the wordmark
            treatment's [wordmark][bell][toggle][avatar] — and the title already
            has `noWrap` with `minWidth: 0`, so it ellipsizes into whatever the
            icons leave rather than pushing them off the edge.

            Renders NOTHING when no `NotificationProvider` is mounted, which is
            how every existing standalone `AppBar` test keeps its exact button
            count. See the note on `useNotifications`. */}
