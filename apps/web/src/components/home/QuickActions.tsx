 * ever set. The `adminOnly` field is gone: it was one of three inconsistent
 * gating idioms (role here, role in the sidebar, permission in the user menu)
 * whose disagreement is the bug this epic closes.
 *
 * The DESCRIPTION prose stays local. It is the one thing genuinely specific to
 * this surface — a rail row and a bottom-bar tab have no room for a sentence,
 * so pushing it into the shared table would give every other surface a field it
 * cannot use.

 * The two entries here are exactly the two destinations `docs/specs/journey-shell.md`
 * §2 moved OFF the bar — so a filter over `DESTINATIONS` would now yield an
 * empty card, silently taking the home page's only route to a user's own
 * settings with it. The four bar destinations are deliberately absent for the
 * opposite reason: the rail and the bottom bar draw all four at every width, so
 * a shortcut to them would be Home duplicating the chrome around it.
