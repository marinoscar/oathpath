/**
 * The destination model — canonical keys, route ownership, and active state.
 *
 * Issue #55, epic #51. This file is the SINGLE source of truth for the app's
 * navigation targets. Before it existed the same four menu paths were spelled
 * out in four places (`App.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `UserMenu.tsx`,
 * `home/QuickActions.tsx`), each with its own idea of who was allowed to see
 * them — which is how a Contributor holding `system_settings:read` ended up
 * with a working System Settings page, a menu entry pointing at it, and no
 * sidebar row: three gates, three answers.
 *
 * Two rules make the ownership table trustworthy:
 *
 *  1. **A route is owned by at most one destination.** A test asserts this
 *     against the live route list in `App.tsx`, which is what keeps the table
 *     honest as routes are added — it fails loudly the day someone adds a
 *     route and forgets this file.
 *  2. **Matching respects segment boundaries.** A bare `startsWith` — what
 *     `Sidebar` used to do — would make `/settings` own `/settingsfoo` and
 *     `/admin/users` own `/admin/users-archive`.
 *
 * `Icon` is declared as a COMPONENT, never as a rendered element. The rail
 * draws it at `small` when collapsed and `medium` when expanded, and the
 * bottom bar draws it at its own size — so the size cannot be baked in here.
 *
 * ONE ADMIN DESTINATION, NOT TWO (issue #92, epic #90)
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * `users` (`/admin/users`) and `system` (`/admin/settings`) used to be two
 * separate rows for what is, to the user, one surface. Issue #92 splits the
 * admin tab strips into one route per settings page under `/admin/settings/*`,
 * and #94 gives the rail a Console mode that swaps its contents to those pages
 * on any `/admin/*` path. Console mode is only coherent if the admin surface is
 * ONE destination: two rows both matching `/admin/*` means two `aria-current`
 * candidates and an ambiguous active state on every admin route. So the two are
 * replaced by a single `console` destination that owns the whole `/admin`
 * subtree.
 *
 * FOUR BAR DESTINATIONS, SIX KEYS (issue #69, epic #50)
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * `docs/specs/journey-shell.md` §2 replaces the bar's contents with the four
 * destinations the LEARNER uses day to day — Home, Learn, Practice, Progress —
 * and moves Settings and Console out of the array. The two halves of the model
 * come apart here, deliberately:
 *
 *   - `DESTINATIONS` answers "what is IN THE BAR", and is now exactly four
 *     entries. The ceiling in `destinations.test.ts` (`length <= 4`) stops
 *     being headroom and becomes an equality in practice: a fifth bar
 *     destination fails an assertion that already exists, with no new test to
 *     write and no way to widen the ceiling by editing the array.
 *   - `DESTINATION_ROUTES` answers "what LIGHTS UP", and still carries all six
 *     keys. `/settings/profile` and `/admin/settings/email` must still resolve
 *     to an active destination — a route owned by nothing highlights nothing,
 *     and the ownership test would (correctly) fail the whole `/settings`
 *     subtree as "neither owned nor deliberately unowned".
 *
 * So `settings` and `console` keep their keys, their routes and their
 * `Destination` objects; what they lose is their seat in the bar. Each is
 * exported on its own for the ONE surface that still draws it —
 * `SETTINGS_DESTINATION` for the user menu, `RAIL_PINNED_DESTINATIONS` for the
 * rail's pinned foot — so a surface has to name what it renders instead of
 * inheriting it from an array it happens to iterate.
