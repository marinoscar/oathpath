/**
 * Issue #91, epic #90 — `visibleSettingsSections` and `settingsPageTitle` are
 * the ONE gate every consumer (hub, rail, AppBar title) runs. A bug here is a
 * bug in three surfaces at once, and this suite is what makes that provable
 * with a single assertion per behavior instead of three near-identical
 * component tests.
 *
 * `visibleSettingsSections` is exercised two ways:
 *   - against a small local FIXTURE, for the cases that need independent
 *     control over `permission` / `alwaysShow` (ADMIN_SECTIONS today has no
 *     `alwaysShow` card, and no card with an undeniable permission either);
 *   - against the REAL `ADMIN_SECTIONS` / `USER_SETTINGS_SECTIONS`, for the
 *     cases that are really about the real data (title-vs-description search,
 *     and "it works for the user registry too").
