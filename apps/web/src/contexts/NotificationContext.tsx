/**
 * The notification centre's state — the durable surface of the browser channel.
 *
 * Issue #127, epic #109. Owns the recent-notification list, the unread count,
 * the SSE connection, and the native toast. Mounted once, in `App.tsx`, around
 * the `Layout` route element — so it exists exactly where the app shell (and
 * therefore the bell in the `AppBar`) exists, and nowhere else.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * THE ORDERING THAT MATTERS: TABLE FIRST, STREAM SECOND, TOAST THIRD
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Three mechanisms, in strict order of authority, and the whole design of this
 * file follows from it:
 *
 *   1. `GET /api/notifications` + `/unread-count` — THE TRUTH. Everything the
 *      bell renders comes from here. This works with the stream down, with
 *      permission denied, in a browser with no `Notification` API at all, and
 *      after any gap of any length.
 *   2. The SSE stream — LIVENESS ONLY. It makes the centre update without a
 *      refresh. It is not a delivery guarantee (no replay, no `Last-Event-ID`,
 *      per-process fan-out), so a missed frame must only ever cost immediacy.
 *   3. `new Notification(...)` — DECORATION. Raised when permission is already
 *      granted, absent otherwise, and nothing depends on it.
 *
 * Anything that inverts this ordering is a bug even if it works in testing. A
 * list populated only by stream frames looks perfect on a developer's machine
 * and is empty on every page load in production.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * ⚠️ REFETCH ON EVERY (RE)CONNECT — `handleStreamOpen` BELOW
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * THE STREAM REPLAYS NOTHING. The API buffers no events, honours no
 * `Last-Event-ID`, and keeps no log; anything published while the connection was
 * down is never seen by this tab. Its stream registry is also PER API PROCESS,
 * so with more than one replica a connected tab still misses events published on
 * another pod.
 *
 * Both are survivable for exactly one reason: the `notifications` row is written
 * to the shared database BEFORE it is published, so the table is always right
 * even when the stream is not. The recovery is therefore to RE-READ THE TABLE
 * WHENEVER A CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED — not just on mount, on EVERY connect,
 * because a reconnect is precisely the event that says "there may have been a
 * gap".
 *
 * If you delete `refresh()` from `handleStreamOpen` because it looks redundant
 * next to the mount fetch: the bell goes stale after the first network blip and
 * stays stale for the life of the tab, and nothing anywhere logs an error. That
 * is the failure this comment exists to prevent.

 * to 20 because a popover is not an archive; the question "have I already
 * counted this one?" must NOT be truncated with it, because the two have
 * different failure modes. A row pushed off the end of the list by truncation

 * counted exactly once — counting it again is the #127 double-count wearing a
 * different hat, and it would be invisible in testing because it needs 20
 * arrivals before it can happen at all.
 *
 * 10× the visible list makes that unreachable in practice: every duplicate race
 * this defends against — multi-tab fan-out, the reconnect refetch racing a live
 * frame, StrictMode's double connect in development — delivers its copies
 * within seconds of one another, never 200 notifications apart.
 *
 * Bounded rather than unbounded because this provider lives in the app shell of
 * a tab that stays open all day; an unbounded set is a leak nothing ever
 * empties. At the cap the oldest id is dropped, so a re-delivery of something

      // The obvious repair — increment from inside the `setNotifications`
      // updater, where the dedupe decision is already made — IS NOT SAFE AND

      //     touches nothing else. Invoke it once or a hundred times and the
      //     result is identical and the count is untouched.
      //   * The ref survives StrictMode's double mount, so the second
