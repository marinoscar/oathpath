/**
 * Shared chrome for every `/settings/*` page that edits the user settings
 * document.
 *
 * Issue #96, epic #90. The exact counterpart of
 * `pages/Admin/SystemSettingsSection.tsx` (#92), for the same reason and with
 * the same shape. `UserSettingsPage` used to be one component stacking three
 * cards, and with it ONE copy of the wiring those cards shared: the
 * `useUserSettings` hook, the loading spinner, the fetch-error alert, and the
 * success/failure snackbars. Splitting the stack into routed pages without
 * extracting that wiring would have produced a copy of it per page — and the
 * whole point of epic #90 is that near-identical copies drift within a release.
 * There is still exactly one copy; it just lives here now.
 *
 * ONE HOOK CALL PER PAGE, NOT ONE FOR THE SURFACE. Each routed page mounts its
 * own `UserSettingsSection`, so each owns its own `useUserSettings()` and its
 * own snackbar state. That is the behavioural change #96 asks for: on the old
 * stacked page a successful theme save raised a toast that sat visually
 * alongside the Profile card, because there was one snackbar for three
 * sections. Two pages that are never mounted together cannot do that. The cost
 * is one `GET /user-settings` per settings page visit, which is the same cost
 * the admin split already accepted and is dwarfed by the page's own chunk.
 *
 * A RENDER PROP rather than an outlet or a HOC — same argument as the admin
 * wrapper. `ThemeSettings` and `ProfileSettings` take `settings` fields as
 * VALUES and are deliberately left untouched by this issue, so the state has to
 * arrive as arguments. It also lets `settings` be NON-NULLABLE in the callback:
 * the null case is handled once, here, so neither page repeats a
 * `settings && …` guard that TypeScript would otherwise demand of both.
 *
 * NO `RequirePermission`, NO `hasPermission` CHECK, unlike the admin wrapper —
 * and that is a deliberate difference, not an omission. These are the user's
 * own settings; the API grants `user_settings:read` / `user_settings:write` to
 * all three roles, and `config/userSettingsSections.tsx` declares no
 * `permission` on any card for the same reason. A gate here would be inventing
 * an authorization rule the API does not enforce, and would lock users out of
 * their own profile.
 *
 * NO `<Paper>` AROUND THE CHILDREN, unlike the admin wrapper. The admin editors
 * are bare form controls that need section chrome; `ThemeSettings`,
 * `ProfileSettings` and `PersonalAccessTokens` each render their own `<Card>`
 * already, and nesting those in a Paper stacks two elevated surfaces with a
 * hairline of background between them.
