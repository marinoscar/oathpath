/**
 * Shared chrome for every `/admin/settings/*` page that edits the system
 * settings document.
 *
 * Issue #92, epic #90. `SystemSettingsPage` used to be one component holding
 * three tabs, and with it ONE copy of the wiring those tabs shared: the
 * `useSystemSettings` hook, the loading spinner, the fetch-error alert, the
 * `canWrite` gate, the success/failure snackbars, and the "last updated by"
 * line. Splitting the tabs into four routed pages without extracting that
 * wiring would have produced four copies of it — and four copies of a
 * permission gate is precisely the split-brain `config/destinations.ts` was
 * written to end. There is still exactly one copy; it just lives here now.
 *
 * A RENDER PROP rather than an outlet or a HOC. The children need `settings`,
 * `canWrite` and `isSaving` as VALUES — `UISettings` and `FeatureFlagsList`
 * take them as props and are deliberately left untouched by this issue — and a
 * render prop hands them over without a context, without a wrapper component
 * per page, and without any page being able to render before `settings` is
 * non-null. That last part is why `settings` is non-nullable in the callback's
 * argument: the null case is handled once, here, so no page repeats a
 * `settings && …` guard that TypeScript would otherwise demand of all four.
 *
 * THE PAGE-LEVEL PERMISSION CHECK IS DEFENCE, NOT THE GATE. `App.tsx` wraps
 * each route in `RequirePermission` with the same string, which is the real
 * enforcement point; this one exists for a page mounted from anywhere else, and
 * it is the check `SystemSettingsPage` already carried. `requiredPermission` is
 * a prop rather than a hardcoded `system_settings:read` because Advanced (JSON)
 * gates on `system_settings:WRITE` — a raw editor over the whole document has
 * no read-only meaning. See `config/adminSections.tsx`.
