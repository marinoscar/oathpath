/**
 * Admin → Settings → Email (`/admin/settings/email`).
 *
 * Issue #124, epic #109. The first settings page added since `CLAUDE.md`'s
 * `MANDATORY: Settings UI Pattern` section landed, so it is deliberately a
 * REGISTRY CARD and nothing else: one entry in `ADMIN_SECTIONS`, one route in
 * `App.tsx` gated on the same permission string, and no tab anywhere. The hub,
 * the Console rail and the compact AppBar title all pick it up from that single
 * declaration — see `docs/specs/settings-ui.md`.
 *
 * WHY THIS DOES NOT USE `SystemSettingsSection` (the render-prop wrapper the
 * four sibling admin pages share). That component is bound to
 * `useSystemSettings`: it loads THE system settings document, saves one branch
 * of it by PATCH, and hands the page a non-null `SystemSettings`. Email is a
 * different controller with a different document and a save contract this page
 * exists to make visible (blank password preserves), plus a second, non-saving
 * action — the test send — that the wrapper has no notion of. Threading all
 * that through it would generalise a shared component to serve exactly one
 * caller. What IS shared is the chrome, reproduced here field for field —
 * container, `h4` title, mirrored card description, "(read-only)" suffix, last
 * updated line, `Paper` body — so the page reads as a sibling rather than as a
 * one-off.
 *
 * THE TEST BUTTON IS THE POINT OF THE PAGE (#124). A wrong SES region, an
 * unverified sender identity and a bad SMTP password all fail, and they fail
 * differently; the provider's own error text is the only thing that tells them
 * apart. So the failure surface here is a persistent, dismissible alert with
 * room for a multi-line provider message — never a snackbar that slides away in
 * five seconds carrying the one string the admin needed to read twice.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE WIRE SHAPE IS FLAT, AND "OFF" IS TWO FIELDS
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `EmailSettings` is one flat object — `sesRegion`, `smtpHost`, `smtpPort` and
 * friends are siblings, not members of `ses: {…}` / `smtp: {…}` groups — and
 * "email is turned off" is `enabled: false`, NOT a third `provider` value. See
 * `types/index.ts` for both, and `providerChoice` / `applyProviderChoice` below
 * for how the two fields reach one radio group without either being lost.

 * and no option matches.
 *
 * NOTE WHAT IS NOT HERE: there is no radio for "off". Turning email off is the

 * that one three-way radio cannot express what the API's two fields do. "Off,
 * SMTP retained" and "off, SES retained" would collapse into the same choice,
 * so switching mail off for a maintenance window would cost the admin the
 * transport they had configured — the exact loss `enabled` exists to prevent.

 *   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   null      false   | (none)       off    | fresh install, nothing set up
 *   null      true    | (none)       on     | rejected by `validate` — on with
 *                                           |   nothing to send through
 *   'ses'     true    | Amazon SES   on     | sending via SES

 *   'ses'     false   | Amazon SES   off    | configured, deliberately off
 *   'smtp'    false   | SMTP         off    | configured, deliberately off
 *
 * There is deliberately no control that returns `provider` to `null` once a
 * transport has been picked. "I do not want mail sent" is the switch; going
 * back to "never configured" is not a state an admin needs to author, and a
 * fourth radio labelled to explain the difference from "off" would be a
