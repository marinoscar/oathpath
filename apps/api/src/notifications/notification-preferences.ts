// =============================================================================
// Preference resolution (issue #125, epic #109)
// =============================================================================
//
// "Should this user get this event on this channel?" — answered in ONE place,
// so the dispatcher, and later the preferences page (#126), cannot hold two
// different opinions.
//
// PURE DATA AND PURE FUNCTIONS. No Nest, no Prisma, no I/O — same discipline
// as notification-events.ts next door, for the same reason: the resolution
// rules below are the subtle part of this issue and a test should be able to
// exercise every branch by calling a function, not by standing up DI and
// seeding a database row.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE STORED SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS CHANNEL-OUTER
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//     user_settings.value = {
//       theme: ..., profile: ...,
//       notifications: {
//         email:   { 'user.welcome': false },
//         browser: { ... }
//       }
//     }
//
// Channel first, event second. The outer key set is CLOSED — it is exactly
// `NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS` — so the outer level of a user-writable blob is
// validated against a known enum rather than being an open string map. The
// inner level has to be an open map either way, because event keys are
// registry data that changes without a migration (see
// `NotificationEventDef.key`). Event-outer would have made BOTH levels open.
//
// It also matches the three-level fallback the issue spells out — absent
// namespace, absent channel, absent event — as three literal lookups rather
// than two lookups and a synthesized middle.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SPARSE ABSENT-KEY CONTRACT — THE RULE THIS WHOLE FILE EXISTS FOR
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Only a DELIBERATE user choice is ever stored. Absent — at any of the three
// levels — means "fall back to the event's `defaultEnabled`". Three things
// depend on that, and each of them breaks loudly if this is got wrong:
//
//   1. NO MIGRATION AND NO BACKFILL. The feature ships by reading a key that
//      is not there yet for anybody. Materialising a preference row per user
//      would need a migration, a backfill, and another backfill for every
//      event added afterwards.
//
//   2. NOBODY IS MUTED ON ARRIVAL. Every existing account has no
//      `notifications` namespace at all. If absent meant "off", the framework
//      would ship silent for the entire user base and the only symptom would
//      be mail nobody receives — a failure with no error anywhere.
//
//   3. AN EVENT ADDED LATER IS OPT-OUT, NOT SILENTLY OPT-IN-ONLY. A user who
//      saved a preference in 2026 has a stored `email` map that says nothing
//      about an event declared in 2027. Absent-means-default gives them that
//      event's intended default. A stored blob written whole — the rejected
//      alternative in #125 — would give them "not in my map, therefore off".
//
// The corollary belongs to #126 and is restated here because this file is
// where the reader will look for it: RE-ENABLING WRITES A NULL DELETE, NOT
// `true`. Pinning `true` re-materialises the key and re-creates exactly the
// staleness the sparse contract avoids.
// =============================================================================

 * an empty (or partial) result, which resolves to the registry defaults.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS NOT ONE `schema.safeParse()`
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A single all-or-nothing parse is the reflex, and it is wrong HERE
 * specifically. This value is user-writable JSONB. One malformed entry — a
 * hand-edited row, a bad client, a crafted PATCH — would fail the whole parse,
 * and the fallback for a failed parse is "no preferences", which means EVERY
 * DELIBERATE MUTE THE USER SET IS SILENTLY UNDONE and they start receiving
 * mail they explicitly turned off. Discarding one bad key is a repair;
 * discarding the whole namespace because of it is a regression the user
 * experiences as spam.
 *
 * So this reads entry by entry and keeps what it understands. Unknown
 * channels are dropped (a preference for a channel the registry no longer
 * declares can never be delivered anyway); unknown event keys are KEPT,
 * because a key this build does not recognise may simply belong to an event
 * added in a newer deployment during a rolling upgrade, and dropping it here
 * would be a lossy read that #126's read-modify-write would then persist.
 *
 * @param settingsValue the raw `user_settings.value` JSONB, or `null`/
 *                      `undefined` when the user has no settings row at all —
 *                      the single most common case, and the one the sparse
 *                      contract is built around.
