// =============================================================================
// Notifications — public surface (issues #121/#124/#125, epic #109)
// =============================================================================
//
// #121 shipped the event registry and its helpers. #124 added the endpoint
// that serves that registry to the web app. #125 added the dispatcher, the
// channel abstraction, the preference resolver and the delivery records. #127
// adds the browser channel: the durable `notifications` store, the SSE
// transport, and the notification centre's endpoints.
//
// FOR A FEATURE THAT WANTS TO SEND A NOTIFICATION, THE WHOLE API IS:
//
//     imports: [NotificationsModule]          // in your module
//     constructor(private readonly notifications: NotificationsService) {}
//     await this.notifications.notify('security.role_changed', userId, data);
//
// That call cannot throw, cannot join your transaction, and returns before
// anything is sent. Nothing else here is needed at a call site.
//
// FOR A RECIPIENT WITH NO ACCOUNT (#128's `allowlist.invitation`), the entry
// point is `notifyAddress(eventKey, email, data)`. It is not a bypass: it
// resolves the address to an account when there is one — so a real user's
// preferences are never skipped — and otherwise dispatches through the same
// gate with empty preferences, which the sparse absent-key contract already
// defines as "use the event's default".
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT EXPORTED: `NotificationDeliveryService`, the two
// channel classes, `NotificationStoreService` and `NotificationStreamService`.
// The preference gate and the `mandatory` override live in
// `NotificationsService.dispatch`; a caller able to invoke a channel directly,
// to write a delivery record for a send that never happened, or to push
// straight into a user's open tabs with no durable row behind it, would be a
// route around the one gate this epic has. `NotificationStoreService` is
// withheld for a second reason — it is the per-user read path, and an
// unscoped consumer of it is an IDOR. The module does not export any of them
// either; this barrel and the module agree on purpose.
//
// #128 filled `EVENT_EMAIL_TEMPLATES` and `EVENT_BROWSER_TEMPLATES` and wired
// the three real triggers — user creation in `AuthService.handleGoogleLogin`,
// `AllowlistService.addEmail`, and `UsersService.updateUserRoles` — which
// closes epic #109. Adding the next notification is three steps and is written
// up under "Adding a notification" in the repository's CLAUDE.md.
