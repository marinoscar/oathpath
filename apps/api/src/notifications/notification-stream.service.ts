// =============================================================================
// NotificationStreamService — the live half of the browser channel (#127, #109)
// =============================================================================
//
// A per-process registry of open SSE connections, keyed by user id. The
// browser channel writes a `notifications` row and then calls `publish` here;
// any tab that user has open receives it without polling.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PER-USER ISOLATION IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A FILTER
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This is the security property the whole issue turns on, so it is built into
// the shape of the registry rather than into a predicate somebody has to
// remember to write.
//
// REJECTED: one process-wide `Subject` that every connection subscribes to,
// each applying `.filter(e => e.userId === me)`. It works, and it is one
// deleted line, one inverted comparison, or one added `.merge()` away from
// broadcasting every user's notifications to every open tab — a leak with no
// error, no failing request and nothing in a log. A reviewer would have to
// notice the absence of a predicate to catch it.
//
// CHOSEN: fan-out at the registry. `subscribers` maps a user id to that user's
// own subscribers, `publish(userId, …)` writes to exactly one bucket, and
// there is NO method on this class that reaches more than one user — no
// broadcast, no "subscribe to everything", no way to reach another user's
// connections. To
// leak a notification you would have to publish it under the wrong key, and
// the key comes from the `user_id` of the row that was just written. The
// controller supplies the id from the authenticated principal
// (`@CurrentUser('id')`) and never from a path, query or body parameter, so
// there is no user-supplied value anywhere on the path that selects a stream.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PER-PROCESS. IT DOES NOT FAN OUT ACROSS REPLICAS. READ THIS BEFORE SCALING.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This Map lives in one Node process's heap. With more than one API replica
// behind the proxy, a user whose tab is connected to pod A receives NOTHING
// for an event published on pod B — their connection simply never sees it.
// There is no error and no retry; the event is not lost, it is just not live
// for that tab.
//
// THAT IS SURVIVABLE ONLY BECAUSE THE TABLE, NOT THE STREAM, IS THE SOURCE OF
// TRUTH. `notifications` rows are written by the channel BEFORE this is
// called, in the shared database every replica reads, so the bell and the
// unread count are correct on every pod. The tab misses the live nudge and
// picks the notification up on its next fetch. Losing liveness is a
// degradation; losing the notification would be a defect, and the ordering
// (row first, publish second) is what keeps it the former.
//
// Making it fan out means a shared bus — Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY, or Redis
// pub/sub — and that is deliberately NOT in #127: this baseline runs a single
// API container, and the failure mode above is a missing toast rather than a
// missing notification. When a second replica is deployed, `publish` is the
// single seam to reimplement; nothing above it moves.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RECONNECTION: `EventSource` RETRIES, BUT NOTHING IS REPLAYED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `EventSource` reconnects on its own after a drop. It does NOT get the events
// it missed while disconnected — this class holds no buffer, honours no
// `Last-Event-ID`, and has no replay log. SSE IS NOT A DELIVERY GUARANTEE, and
// anyone reading this file later will assume it is unless it says so here.
//
// The fix is not replay. THE CLIENT REFETCHES ON (RE)CONNECT — the unread
// count and the recent list, from `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` and
// `GET /api/notifications` — and is therefore correct after any gap of any
// length, including one caused by the multi-replica case above. Building
// replay would add a durable per-connection cursor to make the stream do what
// one indexed query already does correctly.
// =============================================================================

 * 25 SECONDS, chosen to sit comfortably under a 30s idle timeout (the
 * shortest in common use, and half of nginx's current 60s) with room for a
 * scheduling delay. Shorter wastes wakeups on every idle tab; longer starts
 * losing the race with the tightest proxy in the chain.
 *
