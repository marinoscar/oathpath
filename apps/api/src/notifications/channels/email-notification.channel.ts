// =============================================================================
// EmailNotificationChannel (issue #125, epic #109)
// =============================================================================
//
// The one implemented channel. It joins the three halves #121–#123 built and
// left unconnected: an event key from the registry, a template from
// `../../email/templates`, and a transport from `../../email/providers`.
//
// IT IS A CHANNEL, NOT "THE" CHANNEL. `NotificationsService` reaches it only
// through `NotificationChannelSender`, so #127's browser channel is a sibling
// class and a line in the module factory rather than a branch anywhere in the
// dispatcher.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS DUPLICATES SOME OF `EmailTestSendService`'s GATING
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Both check `enabled`, `provider` and `fromAddress` before sending. That is
// deliberate rather than an extraction waiting to happen, because the two want
// OPPOSITE things from a failure. #124's test send is a DIAGNOSTIC: its whole
// output is a sentence for an admin staring at the settings form, it writes an
// `email_settings:test` audit row, and it returns a `TestEmailResult`. This is
// a DELIVERY path: its output is a `notification_deliveries` row, it has no
// admin looking at it, and it must never write an audit event for a message
// nobody asked to send.
//
// What IS shared is the part where duplication would be a bug rather than
// noise: `formatFromHeader` — header escaping, where a second implementation
// means either mail from nobody or an injected header. #124 exported it for
// exactly this call site.
// =============================================================================

/**
 * Notification event key -> the email template that renders it.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FILLED BY #128. THESE THREE LINES ARE HALF OF "WIRING AN EVENT".
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * #125 shipped this empty because inventing a template before anybody had
 * written the copy would ship a message nobody had reviewed. #128 adds the
 * three templates and the three lines here that point at them.
 *
 * EVERY EVENT DECLARING THE `email` CHANNEL MUST APPEAR HERE. A missing entry
 * is not a silent skip: `deliver` below records a FAILED delivery saying no
 * template is registered, so "declared but unsendable" shows up in
 * `notification_deliveries` rather than being invisible.
 *
 * A MAP AND NOT A NAMING CONVENTION. Event keys are dotted (`user.welcome`);
 * template names are kebab-case and match their file (`user-welcome` ->
 * `user-welcome.email.ts`). Deriving one from the other would couple two
 * independently-owned naming schemes and turn a rename into a silent
 * "template not found" at send time — the map is three lines and it is
 * greppable from either side.
 *
 * `Partial<Record<...>>` so a lookup is typed `EmailTemplateName | undefined`
 * and the missing case has to be handled rather than trusted. The VALUES are
 * `EmailTemplateName`, so a typo on the right-hand side is a compile error;
 * only the event keys on the left are unchecked strings, and an unknown one is
 * dead weight rather than a runtime fault (the dispatcher never looks it up).

   * This call site is the one place in the system where it is not. `notify`

   * nothing, and a template reading `data.actor.email` on a caller's typo
   * throws a `TypeError` at runtime. Letting that propagate would violate the
   * containment rule the whole issue is built on — a bad payload for a welcome
   * email would take down the login that triggered it.
   *
   * So it is caught, and it is recorded as a FAILED delivery with the thrown
   * message. The bug is not hidden; it is written down, in the table an
   * operator queries for exactly this, instead of being converted into a 500
   * for an unrelated user action.
