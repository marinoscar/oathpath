// =============================================================================
// A send failure does not fail or roll back its trigger (issue #128, epic #109)
// =============================================================================
//
// THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ASSERTION IN THE EPIC (#109 success criterion 9,
// and the property #128 exists to prove). Everything else in this framework is
// machinery; this is the guarantee that makes it safe to put a `notify()` call
// on a business path at all.
//
// It is asserted at the REAL SEAM rather than in isolation. The dispatcher,
// the delivery-record service and the email channel are all the real classes
// here, wired to a mail provider that is forced to fail, and the trigger is
// the real `UsersService.updateUserRoles`. A test that mocked
// `NotificationsService` would prove only that a mock resolves — it would pass
// just as happily against an implementation that awaited the send inside the
// caller's transaction.
//
// Prisma is mocked, so "commits" here means what it can mean at this layer:
// the role-replacing transaction ran to completion, its writes were issued,
// the audit row was written, and the method RETURNED THE NEW ROLES instead of
// rejecting — while every channel underneath it was failing as hard as it can.
// The complementary end-to-end assertion against a real database belongs with
// the integration suite.
// =============================================================================
