      // polling client could not tell them apart. See

      // is an explicit brand rather than the filter sniffing for an `error` key.

      // the RFC never defines into a protocol response, and a body that is
      // "mostly the spec" is exactly the kind of thing a strict client rejects
      // and a reader stops trusting. The status line still carries the code.

      // putting a bare JSON string on the wire.

      //     nine status-derived values, and says in so many words that the
      //     filter overwrites any `code` an exception supplied. That DTO is the
      //     `default` error response on every operation in the OpenAPI document,
      //     so it is a published contract, not a comment.
      //   * `http-exception.filter.spec.ts` asserts it ("The filter overrides
      //     custom code with standard code mapping"). The behaviour is tested,
      //     not accidental.
      //   * One exception does pass a `code`: `DatabaseSeedException` sends
      //     `DATABASE_SEED_REQUIRED`. Reviving the dead line would have changed
      //     that response's `code` from `INTERNAL_ERROR` to a value outside the
      //     published enum — a silent contract break in the one place nobody
      //     would think to check. Its identifying data is already in `details`,
      //     which the envelope carries through.
