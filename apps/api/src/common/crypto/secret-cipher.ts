// =============================================================================
//
// The primitive underneath every runtime-configured secret this application
// will ever store. Deploy-time secrets (JWT_SECRET, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
// GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET) correctly live in the environment; this module exists
// for the other kind — an SMTP password an administrator types into a form,
// which cannot come from an env var because it needs a redeploy to change.
//
// Payload layout (concatenated, then base64-encoded into one opaque string):
//
//     [iv: 12 bytes][authTag: 16 bytes][ciphertext: variable]
//
// Self-describing on purpose: a single `text` column holds the whole thing, so
// the IV and the auth tag can never be stored in separate columns and drift
// away from the ciphertext they authenticate.
//
// Key source: SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY, a base64-encoded 32 bytes.
// Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
//
// THIS MODULE MUST NOT LOG. Every value passing through it is either a secret,
// a key, or a key-derived value; a Logger here is a plaintext leak waiting for
// someone to raise the log level. Errors carry lengths and variable names only.
// =============================================================================

 * a row across tables — fails authentication instead of decrypting into a
 * context where it means something else. Without this, the only thing standing
 * between an SMTP password blob and being read as, say, an OAuth client secret
 * is whichever code happens to parse it. That is a lateral-movement control,
 * and it is the whole reason `purpose` is a required parameter rather than an
 * option with a default.
 *
 * WHY HMAC-SHA256 AND NOT scrypt/argon2/PBKDF2: those are *password* KDFs, and
 * their slowness exists to punish guessing a low-entropy input. The input here
 * is already 32 bytes of `openssl rand` output — there is nothing to brute
 * force — so a slow KDF would buy zero security and add latency to every
 * decrypt. HMAC over a fixed label keyed by a full-entropy secret is the
 * standard construction for exactly this case (it is HKDF's extract step).
 *
 * WHY THE LABEL IS SAFE TO CONCATENATE: `purpose` is the final field of the
 * label, so distinct purposes always produce distinct labels — the prefix is
 * constant and cannot be shifted into it. If a second variable field were ever
 * added *after* the purpose, this would need explicit length-prefixing to stop
 * ('ab', 'c') and ('a', 'bc') from colliding onto one key.
