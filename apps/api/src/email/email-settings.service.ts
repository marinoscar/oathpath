// =============================================================================
// EmailSettingsService — where email configuration is read from (issue #122)
// =============================================================================
//
// WHERE THESE SETTINGS LIVE, AND WHY
//
// In the existing `system_settings` table, as epic #109 and issue #122 call
// for — but in a row of its OWN, under key 'email', NOT inside the 'global'
// row's blob. No new table, no migration; `system_settings.key` is already
// `@unique` and the table is already keyed for exactly this.
//
// The reason it is not inside the 'global' blob is not taste, it is that the
// blob would eat it. `SystemSettingsService` rebuilds that value field by
// field on every write:
//
//   • replaceSettings (PUT)  → `systemSettingsSchema.parse(dto)`, and zod
//                              STRIPS unknown keys, so anything not in that
//                              schema is dropped from the stored object.
//   • patchSettings (PATCH)  → hand-builds `merged` as `{ ui, features }`,
//                              which discards every other key even on a
//                              partial update.
//
// So an `email` key inside the 'global' blob would be silently destroyed the
// next time an admin saved an unrelated general setting — mail stops working,
// nothing in the audit trail explains why, and the admin's action ("I toggled
// a feature flag") has no visible connection to the outcome ("email is
// unconfigured"). Widening `systemSettingsSchema` does not fix it: a PUT whose
// DTO omits `email` still stores an object without it.
//
// A separate row makes that impossible: the two settings surfaces write
// different rows, and neither can clobber the other. It also keeps SMTP host
// and username out of `GET /api/system-settings`' response, which is a smaller
// blast radius for no extra cost, and it gives #124's page its own version
// counter for optimistic concurrency instead of sharing one with a page that
// has nothing to do with email.
//
// #124 owns the WRITE path and adds it here, next to this read, so both halves
// of "what is the email configuration" stay in one file. That write path also
// routes the SMTP PASSWORD -- to `CredentialsService`, never into the blob --
// for the reason spelled out on `update` below.
// =============================================================================

   * 1. IT DOES NOT THROW ON AN INVALID STORED ROW; it reports the problem in

   *    SEND path and is right to throw -- a corrupt row must not be reported

   *    screen capable of fixing it, leaving no in-app route back. The failure
   *    is still loud: it is in the payload, in front of the person who can act
   *    on it, which is the property the throw exists to protect.
   *
   * 2. IT TOUCHES THE CREDENTIAL STORE, which `get` deliberately does not. A
   *    send path has no business paying for a credential lookup it will not
   *    use, and keeping the two apart means the provider's read stays a single
   *    settings query.
   *
   * The password itself is NOT read here. `describe` returns `CredentialInfo`,
   * a type that carries a compile-time proof it cannot hold secret material,
   * and whose query does not select the ciphertext column at all -- so for
   * this request the encrypted bytes never leave Postgres.

   * credential store and NOWHERE ELSE.
   *
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY THE PASSWORD IS WRITTEN FIRST
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * `CredentialsService.setSecret` rejects (400) a blank secret written to an
   * address that holds nothing yet. Doing the settings write first would mean
   * that request persists an SMTP username with no password behind it and then
   * 400s -- the admin sees a failure, the configuration changed anyway, and the
   * next send fails for a reason the error never mentioned. Password first
   * makes that refusal happen before anything is persisted.
   *
   * The opposite partial failure (credential written, settings write fails) is
   * harmless by construction: a stored password that no settings row points at
   * yet is inert, and the next successful save picks it up. Given the choice
   * of which half to leave orphaned, the inert one is the right answer.
   *
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   * BLANK PRESERVES -- AND WHY `setSecret` IS SKIPPED ENTIRELY WHEN BLANK
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * An empty password field means "I did not retype the password", so the
   * stored one is kept. `CredentialsService` already implements exactly that
   * and this method must not reimplement, second-guess or pre-normalise it:
   * no `.trim()`, no `''` -> `undefined` coercion, no "erase when empty"
   * branch. The value arrives here byte-for-byte as submitted.
   *
   * What this method DOES decide is whether to call `setSecret` at all, and it
   * calls it only for a non-blank value. Calling it with a blank one on a
   * system that has never stored an SMTP password -- an SES deployment, or an
   * IP-authorised relay with no credential -- would raise that first-write 400
   * on an ordinary save that has nothing to do with SMTP. Skipping the call
   * produces the identical outcome for an existing credential (preserved) and
   * the correct one for a non-existent one (still absent, no error).
   *
   * Erasing a stored password is `CredentialsService.deleteSecret`, from a
   * distinct control. It is deliberately not reachable through this endpoint.
   *
   * @param expectedVersion optional `If-Match`; a mismatch is a 409 rather
   *                        than a silent overwrite of a colleague's save.
