# Design Spec: `oathpath deploy` (VPS deployment)

This is the durable design for a new `oathpath deploy` command family in
`apps/cli` that installs and updates this application on a single VPS: git
clone/pull, `docker compose build`, database migration and seeding, and TLS
via a shared host-level proxy. An epic and its child issues link here instead
of restating the design — read this first, then the issue you were sent to
implement.

Source of truth for every claim below:

- `apps/cli/src/program.ts` — command registration, the two stdout/stderr and
  non-zero-exit rules every command (including `deploy`) must keep.
- `apps/cli/src/errors.ts` — `CliError`, the `EXIT` table, and why `ApiError`
  and `NetworkError` are separate types.
- `apps/cli/src/device-login.ts` — the hooks pattern this design copies for
  `DeployHooks`.
- `apps/cli/src/config.ts` — `~/.oathpath/config.json` and the atomic-write
  trick deploy state must repeat, in a different file, for the same reason.
- `apps/cli/src/prompt.ts` — the one prompt primitive that exists today
  (`prompt()`), and the TTY-or-fail rule the wizard inherits.
- `apps/cli/src/tui/tty.ts`, `apps/cli/src/tui/routes.ts`,
  `apps/cli/src/tui/scroll-box.tsx`, `apps/cli/src/tui/layout.tsx` — the TUI
  gate, the closed route union, and the bounded-viewport rule a live deploy
  log must obey.
- `apps/cli/src/commands/api.ts` — the "thin `register*`, real work in a
  separate `run*`" shape every deploy subcommand follows.
- `infra/compose/base.compose.yml`, `infra/compose/prod.compose.yml`,
  `infra/compose/.env.example` — the compose layering and the environment
  contract deploy generates a `.env` against.
- `infra/nginx/nginx.conf` — the in-compose single-origin proxy; the thing
  this design puts *behind* a second, host-level proxy, not the thing it
  replaces.
- `apps/api/scripts/prisma-env.js`, `apps/api/src/config/configuration.ts`,
  `apps/api/src/prisma/prisma.service.ts` — the three places `DATABASE_URL`
  gets rebuilt from `POSTGRES_*`, and the encoding inconsistency between them.
- `apps/api/prisma/seed.ts` — the idempotent seed the update pipeline
  deliberately re-runs by default.
- `apps/api/src/health/health.controller.ts` — `/api/health/ready`, and why
  it is not evidence a migration ran.
- `apps/api/scripts/smoke-test.mjs` — the closest existing thing to a
  deploy-verification script, and the model for `health.ts`'s external check.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — the GHCR build pipeline whose deploy jobs
  are `echo` stubs; the rejected-alternative section below explains why this
  design does not consume it yet.
- `docs/runbooks/rotate-secrets-encryption-key.md` — the house style this
  document follows, and the key model `env-metadata.ts`'s validator for
  `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must match.

**Nothing described past this line exists yet.** There is no `apps/cli/src/deploy/`
directory, no `deploy` subcommand, no `deploy` TUI screen or route, no
`infra/compose/vps.compose.yml`, and none of the four Phase 0 infra fixes in
section 2 have been made. This document is what the epic and its 17 child
issues build *against*, not a description of code already in the repository.
Every fact cited above about the *existing* codebase has been verified
against the files named; the *proposed* architecture in every other section
is a design, not an implementation report, and a child issue is free to
discover a better answer to a specific sub-problem as long as it keeps the
contracts this document promises to the pieces around it (the hooks shape,
the exit codes, the state file location, the log redaction guarantee).

---

## 1. Scope and the four decisions already made

`oathpath deploy` takes this repository (or, far more likely, a fork of it —
see the Architecture Principles in `CLAUDE.md`: this is a template) from "an
empty VPS with Docker installed" to "running, migrated, seeded, and served
over HTTPS at a real domain," and back again on every subsequent `update`.
Four decisions are locked in; do not re-open them in a child issue without
raising it back at the epic level, because each one shapes several modules
at once.

| Decision | What it means | What it rules out |
|---|---|---|
| **Runs on the VPS** | The operator SSHes in with their own credentials, then runs `oathpath deploy install`. The CLI never dials out over SSH itself. | An SSH client or library (`ssh2`) in the CLI; a laptop-driven orchestrator; managing the operator's SSH keys. |
| **Code delivery is git + build** | `git clone`/`git fetch` + `docker compose build` on the server, every time. No image registry in the loop. | Pulling pre-built images from GHCR (see the rejected-alternatives table — the workflow that pushes them exists, but nothing downstream of it does). |
| **TLS via a shared host proxy** | A single nginx + certbot stack at `/opt/infra/proxy`, outside this repository, terminates TLS for every app on the box. The app stack binds `127.0.0.1` only. | Each app owning its own port 443, its own certbot timer, its own nginx process. |
| **External PostgreSQL** | The operator supplies `POSTGRES_*` for a database that already exists; deploy validates it, never creates or manages it. | A `postgres:` service in any compose file. `base.compose.yml` deliberately has none — see its header comment. |

The git-clone-on-server model is also the answer to "how does this stay safe
for a fork of the template": nothing about repo URL or ref is hardcoded
anywhere in the CLI. `repo.ts` (section 5) reads it from the operator's own
checkout, so a fork deploys itself, never the upstream template.

## 2. Phase 0: fix these first, in application code, not CLI code

Four defects exist in the repository today that would make an otherwise
correct `deploy install` fail or silently misbehave. None of them are
deploy-specific bugs — they are pre-existing gaps in `base.compose.yml`,
`prod.compose.yml`, `infra/nginx/nginx.conf`, and `configuration.ts` that
nobody hit yet because nothing has run `base + prod` against a real domain
before. Fix these as ordinary `fix:`/`chore:` commits, independent of and
before the `deploy` command lands, because every later phase assumes they are
already fixed.

| # | Where | The defect | The fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `infra/nginx/nginx.conf` (`web_upstream`) | Proxies `/` to `web:5173` — Vite's dev port. The `production` target of `apps/web/Dockerfile` serves the built static files from **nginx on port 80**. `base + prod` today has a frontend upstream nothing listens on. | Add a second nginx config, e.g. `infra/nginx/nginx.prod.conf`, with `web:80` as the upstream, and have `prod.compose.yml` mount it over the default. `dev.compose.yml` keeps using the existing file unchanged — it is correct for the dev target. |
| 2 | `base.compose.yml` (`api.environment`) | The `api` service's `environment:` block is a hand-maintained allowlist. It never passes `APP_URL`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `STORAGE_PROVIDER`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`, `SIGNED_URL_EXPIRY`, `STORAGE_PART_SIZE`, or any `DEVICE_*` variable — all of which `configuration.ts` reads. | Replace the allowlist with `env_file: .env` on the `api` service (docker compose resolves that path relative to the compose file's directory, i.e. `infra/compose/.env` — exactly where local dev already puts it). This is also what makes a fork's own added variables reach the container with zero compose-file changes. |
| 3 | `base.compose.yml` (`nginx.ports`) | `"3535:80"` binds `0.0.0.0`. Fine for local dev; on a VPS behind a shared proxy it exposes the app stack directly on the public interface, bypassing the proxy and its TLS entirely. | Not fixed in `base.compose.yml` itself, since local dev legitimately wants `0.0.0.0`. Fixed by `vps.compose.yml` (section 10) overriding it to `"127.0.0.1:3535:80"`. Listed here because it is the same family of bug as #1 and #2 and must be understood together with them. |
| 4 | `apps/api/src/config/configuration.ts` | `constructDatabaseUrl` does **not** URL-encode `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, while `apps/api/scripts/prisma-env.js` and `PrismaService`'s `buildConnectionString` both do. A password containing `@`, `:`, `/`, or `#` builds a URL here that Prisma's own tooling would have encoded correctly, and the two can disagree about what host/port/db the connection string even means. | `encodeURIComponent(password)` in `configuration.ts`, matching the other two call sites. Low blast radius on generated passwords (unlikely to contain reserved characters) but a real trap for an operator who reuses an existing DB password that does. `env-wizard.ts` (section 6) should also warn, not silently accept, a password containing URL-reserved characters until this is fixed. |

## 3. Command surface and exit codes

```
oathpath deploy install [--repo <url>] [--ref <ref>] [--path <dir>] [--domain <fqdn>]
                       [--all] [--non-interactive] [--dry-run] [--skip-seed]
oathpath deploy update   [--force] [--skip-seed] [--dry-run]
oathpath deploy status   [--raw]
oathpath deploy doctor   [--all]
```

Each is a thin `registerXCommand` delegating to a `runX` function, exactly
like `registerApiCommand`/`runApiCommand` in `commands/api.ts` — the split
exists so a test can call `runInstall(...)` directly without going through
commander's argument parsing.

`deploy install` is idempotent and resumable by design (section 7): running
it again after a partial failure re-does only what has not already
succeeded, rather than requiring an operator to hand-diagnose which step to
resume from. `deploy update` is the day-2 command; it refuses to run against
a directory `install` has not already set up (section 8).

New exit code, additive per `errors.ts`'s own contract ("Add new codes; do
not renumber existing ones"):

```ts
export const EXIT = {
  OK: 0,
  FAILURE: 1,
  USAGE: 2,
  API: 3,
  NETWORK: 4,
  AUTH: 5,
  /**
   * A required doctor/preflight check failed before any destructive step ran.
   * Distinct from FAILURE because "your DB is unreachable" and "this CLI hit
   * a bug" have different owners and different next actions — a script
   * driving `deploy install` in a bootstrap pipeline should be able to tell
   * "environment isn't ready yet, retry after fixing DNS" apart from
   * "something is actually broken here."
   */
  PRECONDITION: 6,
} as const;
```

`PreconditionError extends CliError` with `exitCode = EXIT.PRECONDITION`,
thrown by `doctor.ts` and by the preflight step of `install.ts`/`update.ts`.
Everything else deploy throws is an existing `CliError` subclass where one
already fits (`UsageError` for a bad flag, `NetworkError` for an unreachable
DB or registry, a new narrow `DeployStepError` — see section 4 — for a step
that ran and failed on its own terms).

## 4. Module map

```
apps/cli/src/deploy/
  executor.ts       # spawn wrapper: argv only, no shell, timeout, streamed capture
  journal.ts        # run log to disk (human .log + machine .jsonl), retention, redaction
  state.ts          # deploy state file, separate from ~/.oathpath/config.json
  hooks.ts          # DeployHooks — the CLI/TUI seam
  env-spec.ts       # parse .env.example -> EnvSpec[]
  env-metadata.ts   # annotations for the keys needing special handling
  env-wizard.ts     # prompt loop -> writes .env (0600)
  repo.ts           # resolve origin/ref dynamically; clone/fetch/checkout
  proxy.ts          # vhost render/install/validate/rollback + certbot webroot
  health.ts         # container status, /api/health/ready polling, external HTTPS
  checks/           # doctor check registry (one module per check, see section 9)
  steps/            # named steps consumed by install.ts and update.ts
  doctor.ts
  install.ts
  update.ts
  status.ts
apps/cli/src/commands/deploy.ts     # registers install/update/status/doctor, renders hooks to stderr
apps/cli/src/tui/screens/deploy.tsx # renders the same hooks as React state
infra/compose/vps.compose.yml       # the third compose overlay (section 10)
```

Every file above but `checks/` and `steps/` is a single module with one job;
`checks/` and `steps/` are directories because both are meant to grow by
adding a file and one registry entry, not by editing a long `switch`.

## 5. `repo.ts`: resolving the repo without hardcoding it

The operator's workflow is: SSH in, `git clone` (or already have cloned)
**their fork**, `cd` into it, build `oathpath` from source
(`npm run build --workspace=cli`, per the CLI's own README), and run
`oathpath deploy install` from inside that checkout. `repo.ts` leans on
exactly that: it walks upward from `process.cwd()` looking for a `.git`
directory (the same thing `git` itself does to find the repository root),
and when it finds one, reads:

```bash
git -C <root> remote get-url origin
git -C <root> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD   # falls back to a symbolic-ref
                                             # lookup if HEAD is detached
```

as the defaults for `--repo` and `--ref`. This is what makes the tool fork-
safe with zero configuration: the template repository's URL never appears
anywhere in `apps/cli`, so a fork that has renamed everything still deploys
itself. `--repo`/`--ref` override the detected values outright; if `cwd` is
not inside a git working tree at all and neither flag is given, `install`
fails fast with a `UsageError` naming both flags — there is no silent
fallback to the template's own origin, because guessing wrong here means
deploying the wrong application.

The **deploy root** (default `/opt/<repo-name>`, overridable with `--path`)
is where the CLI manages its own clone and everything else it writes (`.env`,
the state file, the run journal). It is deliberately not required to be the
same directory as the checkout `repo.ts` read the defaults from — an
operator who builds `oathpath` in `~/src/myfork` and deploys to `/opt/myapp` is
a normal, supported split. On a first `install`, `repo.ts` clones
`--repo`/detected URL at `--ref`/detected ref into `<deploy-root>/repo`; on
`update`, it `git fetch`s and compares the resolved ref's SHA against
`state.json`'s recorded `commitSha` before doing anything else (section 8).

`executor.ts` is what actually runs `git`, `docker`, `docker compose`,
`certbot`, and `openssl`-equivalent operations. It generalizes the one
existing subprocess precedent, `browser.ts`'s use of `spawn`: explicit
`argv` (never a shell string — the domain, repo URL and ref are all
operator-supplied and must never be interpolated into something a shell
re-parses), `shell: false`, `once('error')`/`once('spawn')` handling, and a
timeout. It adds two things `browser.ts` didn't need: **streamed capture**
(stdout/stderr are both relayed line-by-line to `DeployHooks.onLog` *and*
accumulated for the journal, because a `docker compose build` can run for
minutes and an operator watching it — in the plain command or the TUI —
needs to see it happen, not receive a wall of text after the fact) and an
`AbortSignal` that SIGTERMs the child (the TUI's Esc-to-cancel, section 11,
depends on this).

## 6. The env wizard: generated from `.env.example`, not hardcoded

This is the property that keeps the wizard correct against a fork's own
edits, for the same reason `commands/api.ts` is one generic command instead
of one hand-written subcommand per resource: a wizard with its own list of
34 field names goes stale the day a fork adds `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` or removes
the Microsoft OAuth block. Instead:

**`env-spec.ts`** parses `infra/compose/.env.example` structurally, not with
a hardcoded key list:

- `# ---...---` banner pairs become section headers (`Application`,
  `Database (PostgreSQL)`, `JWT / Session`, ...).
- Consecutive `#`-prefixed lines immediately above a key become that key's
  help text (this is exactly the prose already in the file — e.g. the whole
  `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` block explaining when it's optional).
- An active `KEY=value` line is a required-shape entry; a commented-out
  `# KEY=value` line (the Microsoft OAuth block) is an **optional** entry —
  present in the parsed spec, but not written to the generated `.env` unless
  the operator opts in.
- A trailing inline comment on the value (`MAX_FILE_SIZE=10737418240  # 10GB
  in bytes`) is stripped from the value and folded into the help text.
  Compose's own `.env` parser does not strip these — a `.env` written
  verbatim from a value that still carries `  # 10GB in bytes` would hand
  that whole string to the container as `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, and Node's
  `parseInt` would silently truncate it at the first non-digit rather than
  erroring, so this step is not cosmetic.

Result: `EnvSpec[]`, each entry `{ key, section, defaultValue, help,
required: boolean, commentedOut: boolean }`.

**`env-metadata.ts`** is the *only* hardcoded list in the whole subsystem,
and it is deliberately small — annotations for keys that need behavior
`env-spec.ts` cannot infer from the file's own text:

| Kind | Applies to | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `secret: true` | `JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, the `UPTRACE_*`/`CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` credentials | Masked input when typed (see `promptSecret` below); the value feeds `journal.ts`'s redaction list (section 7) unconditionally, whether the operator typed it or the wizard generated it. |
| `generate: 'base64-32'` | `JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | The wizard offers "generate one" as the default action, using `node:crypto`'s `randomBytes(32).toString('base64')` **in-process** — not a shell-out to `openssl`, even though the `.env.example` comment tells a *human* to run `openssl rand -base64 32`. Shelling out would make `openssl` a new precondition this doctor check would have to verify on every VPS; Node already has the primitive. |
| `validate: minLength(32)` | `JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET` | Matches the API's own documented minimum. |
| `validate: base64Decodes32Bytes` | `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Must decode to exactly 32 bytes — this is the AES-256 key `secret-cipher.ts` expects (see `rotate-secrets-encryption-key.md` for the cipher this key feeds). A key that merely looks base64 but decodes to the wrong length must be rejected here, before it becomes a boot-time failure the operator sees an hour later. |
| `derivedFrom` | `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` from `APP_URL`; `APP_URL` from the one domain question | The wizard asks for the public domain once ("What domain will this be served at?") and derives `APP_URL=https://<domain>` and `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=https://<domain>/api/auth/google/callback`, showing both as defaults the operator can still override — never silently computed with no visibility. |
| `essential: true` | `APP_URL`, all six `POSTGRES_*`, `JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` (~13 keys) | Prompted by default. Everything else in the spec takes its template default silently unless `--all` is passed, in which case the wizard walks every key — required and optional/commented-out alike — offering keep-default / edit / (for optional keys) skip. |

A key present in `.env.example` with no `env-metadata.ts` entry still gets a
prompt when it's `essential` by inference (no safe non-empty default) or is
silently defaulted otherwise — the metadata file narrows behavior for known
keys, it does not gate which keys the wizard can see. A fork that adds
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to `.env.example` and nothing to `env-metadata.ts` still
gets asked for it (plain-text prompt, no masking, no generation) rather than
being invisible to the wizard; the fork can add a `secret: true` entry later
to upgrade that experience.

**`env-wizard.ts`** is the prompt loop, and it needs primitives `prompt.ts`
does not have today — that file has exactly one, free-text `prompt()`, by
design (see its own header: "this CLI asks exactly one question"). Deploy
needs three more, added to `prompt.ts` rather than duplicated in
`env-wizard.ts`, so the TUI's future rich equivalents (`ink-text-input` /
`ink-select-input`, already dependencies) have one command-line behavior to
match:

- **`promptConfirm(question, default)`** — yes/no, same TTY-or-throw rule as
  `prompt()`.
- **`promptSecret(question)`** — masked input. `node:readline` has no
  built-in echo suppression; the standard workaround is a custom output
  `Writable` (or overriding the `Interface`'s internal `_writeToOutput`)
  that substitutes `*` for each keystroke instead of echoing it, restoring
  normal output once the line is submitted. This is exactly the kind of
  fiddly terminal-mode code `prompt.ts`'s own header calls out as the reason
  a bare readline interface — not a dependency — was chosen for the simple
  case; it stays true here, it is just more work for this one case.
  **Only used for values a human types** (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` when not already known) — generated secrets never go
  through a prompt at all.
- **`promptSelect(question, choices, default)`** — a fixed-choice prompt:
  type a number or the first few characters, or (in the ink TUI) an actual
  arrow-key list via the existing `ink-select-input` dependency. Used by the
  `--all` review loop's keep/edit/skip choice per key.

The finished `.env` is written to `<deploy-root>/repo/infra/compose/.env` —
the exact path local development already uses (`cp
infra/compose/.env.example infra/compose/.env`), which is also where docker
compose looks for a `.env` file by default when invoked from that directory
(the existing `Key Commands` in `CLAUDE.md` already `cd infra/compose`
before every `docker compose` invocation; deploy's `executor.ts` does the
same). It is written with the identical atomic-write discipline as
`config.ts`'s `writeConfigFile`: a freshly-created `wx`-flagged temp file at
mode `0600` in the same directory, then `renameSync` over the target — never
`writeFileSync` directly over an existing file, because (per that function's
own extensive comment) `mode` only applies to file *creation*, so overwriting
in place would silently leave a previously-`0644` `.env` world-readable
forever. `env-wizard.ts` should treat this as a library call into (or a
copy of the documented technique from) `config.ts`, not a new, weaker
reimplementation.

## 7. Install pipeline

Every step is individually idempotent and safe to re-run — `install`'s
whole contract is "run it again after any failure and it picks up where it
left off," not "resume from a saved cursor." Steps, in order:

1. **Preflight** — every `required`-level doctor check (section 9) must
   pass; a `recommended` failure prints a warning and continues. Throws
   `PreconditionError` (exit 6) on any required failure, before anything is
   written or fetched.
2. **Resolve deploy root** — create `<deploy-root>` if absent (`mkdir -p`).
3. **Clone/checkout at ref** (`repo.ts`) — clone if `<deploy-root>/repo`
   doesn't exist; if it does (a re-run after a partial failure), fetch and
   checkout instead of re-cloning.
4. **Env wizard** (`env-wizard.ts`) — skipped if a valid `.env` already
   exists at the target path *and* `--non-interactive` was passed; otherwise
   always offered, because a re-run is exactly when an operator fixes a
   typo'd credential.
5. **Validate env** — DB connectivity + credentials + "does this database
   exist" (a real `SELECT 1` against the configured `POSTGRES_*`, not a
   syntax check on the connection string), format validation on every
   `env-metadata.ts` `validate` entry, best-effort S3 reachability (a
   warning, not a hard failure — an admin can configure storage after first
   login).
6. **Build images** — `docker compose -f base.compose.yml -f prod.compose.yml
   -f vps.compose.yml build`, streamed through `executor.ts`.
7. **Migrate** — `npm run prisma:migrate` (i.e. `prisma migrate deploy`)
   run **inside the built `api` image** (`docker compose run --rm api npm
   run prisma:migrate`), with `POSTGRES_*` exported into that run's
   environment explicitly. This matters because `prisma-env.js` only loads
   `.env` files when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` — a production migrate step
   that relied on dotenv loading would silently see no `POSTGRES_*` at all
   and fall back to the hardcoded `localhost`/`postgres`/`postgres`
   defaults, which is a believable way to migrate the wrong database. This
   step's own exit code is the only thing that step of the pipeline trusts
   as proof migrations ran — see the note on `/api/health/ready` below.
8. **Seed** — `docker compose run --rm api npm run prisma:seed`. Safe to
   re-run: `apps/api/prisma/seed.ts` is fully idempotent (every write is an
   upsert).
9. **`up -d`** — start `nginx`, `api`, `web` per the compose overlay.
10. **Wait for health** — poll `http://127.0.0.1:<bound-port>/api/health/ready`
    (loopback, before the shared proxy is even touched) with backoff up to a
    timeout. **This step proves the process is up and can reach Postgres at
    all — nothing more.** `HealthController`'s Terminus check issues a bare
    `SELECT 1`, which **passes against an empty, unmigrated database**. It
    is not, and must never be treated as, evidence step 7 succeeded; step
    7's own exit code is that evidence. Conflating the two is exactly the
    kind of "it looked healthy" false confidence this document exists to
    prevent someone from re-discovering the hard way.
11. **Install vhost + issue certificate + validate + reload** (`proxy.ts`,
    section 10). Rolled back on any validation failure — see that section
    for the mechanics.
12. **External HTTPS verification** — an outbound request to
    `https://<domain>/api/health/ready`, following redirects, checking both
    the HTTP status and that the TLS handshake actually completed against a
    certificate for that name (a self-signed fallback or a proxy
    misconfiguration can serve 200 over broken TLS just as easily as over
    good TLS — this check must fail on the second case too). Modeled on
    `apps/api/scripts/smoke-test.mjs`'s own "boot it and hit the health
    endpoints" verification, one layer further out.
13. **Summary** — print (stderr for the command, a final screen state for
    the TUI) the domain, the commit SHA deployed, and the exact next steps
    (log in as `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, where the state/journal files live).

## 8. Update pipeline

```
require state.json + <deploy-root>/repo + .env + the compose files
  -> else: "not installed here, run `oathpath deploy install`" (PreconditionError)
fetch; compare resolved ref's SHA against state.commitSha
  -> unchanged and no --force: print "already up to date at <sha>", exit 0, do nothing else
record previous SHA (for the summary; there is no automatic rollback — see below)
env drift check: any .env.example key with no counterpart in the existing .env
  -> interactive: offer to run the wizard for just the new keys
  -> --non-interactive: PreconditionError naming the missing keys
build
migrate  (prisma migrate deploy is itself additive/idempotent against a DB
          already at a later state — this is Prisma's own guarantee, not
          something this pipeline adds)
seed, BY DEFAULT — a deliberate divergence from any shell-script precedent,
  which never re-seeds. The seed is idempotent, so this is how permissions
  or role rows added by a newer version of the seed actually land on an
  existing install. `--skip-seed` opts out for an operator who has hand-
  edited seeded rows and does not want them upserted back.
up -d
wait for health
refresh vhost / renew certificate if within certbot's renewal window
  (proxy.ts owns "is this cert due"; update does not force-reissue every run)
external verification
summary, including the previous SHA so a stuck update is easy to read as a diff
```

There is deliberately no automatic rollback on a failed `update`. Recording
the previous SHA is for the operator's own `git checkout <previous-sha>` +
re-run of `install`, not for the CLI to attempt unattended — reverting a
database migration safely is a decision that needs a human, not a heuristic.

## 9. Doctor: the preflight check registry

`checks/` holds one module per check, each exporting the same shape,
consumed by both `oathpath deploy doctor` directly and by `install`/`update`'s
own preflight step — one registry, two callers, the same pattern this
codebase already uses for `NOTIFICATION_EVENTS` and the settings-page
registries: declare the check once, let every consumer read the same list
instead of maintaining a second one that can drift.

```ts
interface DeployCheck {
  id: string;                       // e.g. 'docker-daemon', 'dns-resolves'
  level: 'required' | 'recommended';
  description: string;              // shown in `doctor` output
  run(ctx: DeployCheckContext): Promise<CheckResult>;
}

type CheckResult =
  | { status: 'pass' }
  | { status: 'warn'; message: string }
  | { status: 'fail'; message: string; remedy?: string };
```

Checks to include at minimum: `docker` and `docker compose` v2 present and
the daemon reachable; `git` present; outbound network reachable (DNS
resolves, a TCP connect to the configured `POSTGRES_HOST:POSTGRES_PORT`
succeeds); the configured domain's DNS actually resolves to this host's
public IP (a certbot HTTP-01 challenge will otherwise fail with a message
that does not mention DNS at all); `<deploy-root>` exists or is creatable
and has free disk space above a floor; nothing else is already bound to the
port `vps.compose.yml` binds nginx to; database connectivity + credentials
+ "database exists" (the same check the install pipeline's step 5 runs —
`doctor` runs it standalone so an operator can diagnose DB access *before*
attempting a full install).

`oathpath deploy doctor` with no flags runs `required` checks only and exits
`PRECONDITION` on any failure; `--all` also runs `recommended` checks and
reports warnings without affecting the exit code.

## 10. `proxy.ts`: the shared host proxy and the app's own vhost

`/opt/infra/proxy` is a second, independent Docker Compose project —
**outside this git repository**, living only on the VPS's filesystem — that
this design assumes is either already running (a second app on the same box
deployed it first) or gets bootstrapped by the first `oathpath deploy install`
to ever run on a given VPS. It is not part of `infra/compose/` and is not
versioned alongside the application; it is host infrastructure, shared by
every app deployed to that box. `proxy.ts`'s job:

1. **Bootstrap if absent** — check for `/opt/infra/proxy/docker-compose.yml`;
   if missing, write a minimal nginx + certbot compose project (an nginx
   container publishing `0.0.0.0:80` and `0.0.0.0:443`, a `conf.d/` directory
   mounted in for per-app vhosts, a `webroot/` directory mounted in for
   ACME HTTP-01 challenges, a certs volume) and `docker compose up -d` it.
   This is the **only** thing in the whole design that binds a public port —
   everything else in `vps.compose.yml` is loopback-only.
2. **Render the vhost** for this app's domain into
   `/opt/infra/proxy/conf.d/<domain>.conf`, proxying to
   `127.0.0.1:<bound-port>` (the port `vps.compose.yml`'s nginx service
   binds — default `3535`, matching local dev, but distinct per app on a box
   hosting more than one).
3. **Issue the certificate** via certbot's **webroot** method against the
   shared proxy's `webroot/` mount — never the standalone/`--nginx` plugin
   method, because that plugin wants to own nginx's config itself, which
   conflicts with a proxy shared across apps it doesn't know about.
4. **Validate**: run `nginx -t` *inside the proxy container* against the
   newly rendered config before reloading anything.
5. **Reload** (`docker exec <proxy-container> nginx -s reload`) only if
   validation passed.
6. **Roll back** on any failure in 3-4: restore the previous vhost file (or
   remove it, on a first install with nothing to restore to) and leave the
   previous, known-good nginx state serving traffic. A failed cert issuance
   or a bad vhost render must never take down every other app sharing that
   proxy.

Illustrative shape of a rendered vhost (abbreviated — the real template also
carries the standard TLS cipher/protocol hardening lines, omitted here):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.example.com;
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { root /webroot; }
    location / { return 301 https://$host$request_uri; }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name app.example.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3535;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Note `X-Forwarded-Proto` is set **here**, at the shared proxy — the
in-compose `infra/nginx/nginx.conf` already forwards it onward
(`proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme` in its own `/api` and `/`
blocks) but is itself sitting behind another proxy on a VPS, so the value it
sees and passes on must originate at the outermost hop, not be invented
partway through. `apps/api/src/main.ts`'s trust-proxy configuration (outside
this document's scope) is what makes NestJS honor it once it arrives.

## 11. The CLI/TUI seam: `DeployHooks`

This is the single most important pattern to get right, and it is not new —
it is `device-login.ts` copied faithfully. `apps/cli/src/device-login.ts`'s
own header states the rule: **nothing in the business-logic module writes
to a terminal.** Everything a human would see is delivered through a hooks
object; `commands/login.ts` renders those hooks as stderr lines and
`tui/screens/login.tsx` renders the identical callbacks as React state. Two
renderers, one sequence, and the sequence is the thing that gets tested.

```ts
export interface DeployStep {
  id: string;            // matches a steps/ module, e.g. 'migrate'
  label: string;          // "Running database migrations"
}

export interface StepResult {
  status: 'ok' | 'skipped' | 'failed';
  message?: string | undefined;
  durationMs: number;
}

export interface DeployHooks {
  onStepStart?: ((step: DeployStep) => void) | undefined;
  onStepResult?: ((step: DeployStep, result: StepResult) => void) | undefined;
  /** A line of subprocess output, already ANSI-stripped. */
  onLog?: ((line: string, level: 'info' | 'warn' | 'error') => void) | undefined;
  /** For a long step (build, migrate) that has no natural sub-steps to report. */
  onProgress?: ((info: { completed: number; total: number }) => void) | undefined;
}
```

`install.ts`/`update.ts` take `hooks?: DeployHooks` exactly like
`runDeviceLogin` takes `options.hooks`, and neither ever calls
`process.stdout.write`/`process.stderr.write` directly — `commands/deploy.ts`
does that, formatting `onLog` as a line and `onStepResult` as a
`✓ Migrated database (2.1s)`-shaped line, following `formatStatusLine`'s
existing precedent in `output.ts`. `tui/screens/deploy.tsx` instead
accumulates `onLog` lines into component state feeding a `ScrollBox`
(section 12) and renders `onStepResult` as a checklist.

## 12. Logging: the run journal

Every invocation of `install`/`update`/`doctor` writes two files under
`<deploy-root>/logs/`: a timestamped human-readable `.log` and a matching
machine-readable `.jsonl`, one JSON object per executed command —
`{ argv, cwd, exitCode, durationMs, stdout, stderr, startedAt }`. Retention
keeps the newest N runs (a small constant, e.g. 20) and deletes older ones
at the start of each run, the same "prune on write, not on a schedule"
approach as nothing needing a cron job.

**Redaction is mandatory and happens before a single byte reaches disk.**
Every value `env-metadata.ts` marks `secret: true` — whether generated by
the wizard or typed by the operator — is collected into a redaction list
once the `.env` is known, and `journal.ts` does a literal substring replace
of each value with a fixed placeholder across every line of captured
stdout/stderr and every recorded `argv`, for both the `.log` and the
`.jsonl`. State the honest boundary of this: it is a substring match against
*known* secret values, not a pattern-based scan — a value `env-metadata.ts`
does not know to be secret (a fork's own newly added credential with no
metadata entry) will not be redacted, because there is nothing to compare
against. This is precisely why section 6 says a fork adding a new secret-ish
key should add a `secret: true` entry: doing so is what makes both masking
*and* redaction apply to it. Console output during a run gets the *rendered*
summary (via `DeployHooks`, already free of raw secret material by
construction — nothing puts a secret value into an `onLog` line in the
first place); the file gets the full captured output, redacted the same
way.

## 13. Deploy state

`<deploy-root>/state.json`, **not** `~/.oathpath/config.json` — this is a hard
requirement, not a style preference. `writeConfigFile` "replaces the whole
file and drops unknown keys" (`config.ts`'s own words); if deploy state
shared that file, the next `oathpath login` on the same VPS (an operator
re-authenticating the CLI itself against the API, entirely unrelated to
deploy) would silently erase every field deploy had written. `state.ts`
must implement the identical temp-file-then-rename, mode-at-creation
pattern `writeConfigFile` uses (section 6 makes the same requirement for
`.env`), for the identical reason: a crash or a full disk mid-write must
leave the previous, valid state file intact rather than a truncated one that
reads as corrupt.

```ts
interface DeployState {
  repoUrl: string;
  ref: string;
  commitSha: string;          // as of the last successful install/update
  domain: string;
  boundPort: number;          // what vps.compose.yml bound nginx to, locally
  installedAt: string;        // ISO 8601, set once, never overwritten
  updatedAt: string;          // ISO 8601, set on every successful run
  cliVersion: string;      // CLI_VERSION at time of write
  lastCommand: 'install' | 'update';
  lastSuccessAt: string;      // ISO 8601
}
```

`status.ts` reads this file (never required to exist — `status` on a
never-installed directory reports that plainly, not as an error) and
augments it with live data: `docker compose ps` per-service state, an
immediate `/api/health/ready` poll, the certificate's expiry date, and how
many commits (if any) the tracked ref is ahead of `state.commitSha` — the
last one answering "is there an update available" without performing one.

## 14. TUI integration

A new route joins the closed union in `tui/routes.ts`:

```ts
export type Route = 'menu' | 'login' | 'invoke' | 'status' | 'logout' | 'deploy';
```

...listed in `screens/menu.tsx`, switched on in `app.tsx`, and
`tui/screens/deploy.tsx` follows the existing screen contract exactly: one
`onDone: () => void` prop, a discriminated-union state machine, an
`AbortController` in a ref aborted on unmount, `useInput` gated by
`isActive` whenever a child (a text field, the confirm prompt, the eventual
select list) owns the keyboard.

The live step/log view reuses `ScrollBox` — its own header already explains
why: ink redraws the *entire* frame on every state change, so an unbounded
list of `<Text>` lines behind a minutes-long `docker compose build` is
exactly the failure mode that component exists to prevent. Two things
`ScrollBox` does not do today that this screen needs:

- **`followTail`** — a new prop, off by default (matching the existing
  behavior an operator scrolling old JSON output relies on) but the natural
  default *while a deploy step is actively running*: new log lines should
  keep the viewport pinned to the bottom unless the operator has manually
  scrolled up, at which point auto-follow disengages until they return to
  the bottom. This is genuinely new work, not a trivial prop threading.
- **ANSI-free input, still enforced** — `executor.ts` must strip ANSI
  escapes from captured output before it ever reaches a hook (section 5),
  which is what keeps this a non-issue for `ScrollBox` rather than a second
  place needing the same fix `screens/invoke.tsx`'s existing note about
  colour-run slicing already documents.

**The abort-safety honesty this screen must carry**: unlike
`device-login.ts`'s poll loop, which is safe to abort at any point because
polling has no side effect of its own, a deploy step mid-flight
(`docker compose build`, a migration) is not uniformly safe to interrupt.
`executor.ts` SIGTERMs the child on abort, and `docker compose build`
interrupted mid-layer or a migration interrupted mid-statement can leave a
genuinely partial state. The screen must say so on Esc — a confirmation
naming the risk ("this may leave a partial deployment; re-running install
will resume safely") — rather than implying cancellation is free the way it
is on the login screen. This is the one place this design's "everything is
idempotent, so re-running is always the fix" promise needs a caveat spoken
out loud to the operator at the moment it matters, not buried in this
document.

**The exit-code inversion also matters here.** `tui/index.tsx` today lets a
failed *interactive* operation still exit the process with 0 — the TUI
itself completed even though the thing it did failed. `oathpath deploy
install` run as an explicit subcommand must not inherit that: a scripted
`oathpath deploy install --non-interactive` in a bootstrap pipeline needs the
real exit code (0, or `PRECONDITION`/`FAILURE`/etc.), because that is
exactly the class of automation `program.ts`'s two binding rules exist to
serve. The TUI screen's own "operation failed" state can still return 0 to
`onDone` for the *menu* to keep working — but the explicit `deploy install`
command path, going through `program.ts`'s ordinary `run()`, must not.

## 15. `infra/compose/vps.compose.yml`

A third overlay, layered the same way `dev.compose.yml` and
`prod.compose.yml` already are:

```bash
docker compose -f base.compose.yml -f prod.compose.yml -f vps.compose.yml up -d
```

Its whole job, once Phase 0's fixes land in `base.compose.yml` and
`prod.compose.yml` themselves, is the one override that is legitimately
VPS-specific and wrong for local dev: binding nginx to loopback only.

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3535:80"
```

Nothing else belongs in this file. The `env_file` fix, the `nginx.prod.conf`
mount, and the memory limits all belong in `base.compose.yml`/
`prod.compose.yml` because they are correct for *any* production-like run,
VPS or otherwise — keeping `vps.compose.yml` to the one line that is
specifically "there is a shared proxy in front of me" is what keeps the
compose layering legible instead of every overlay re-deciding the same
things slightly differently.

## 16. Rejected alternatives

| Alternative | Why it lost |
|---|---|
| **Drive the VPS over SSH from a laptop** | Requires bundling an SSH client/library (`ssh2` or a shell-out to system `ssh`), a private-key or agent-forwarding story, and turns ordinary network flakiness between the laptop and the VPS into deploy failures. The confirmed model instead reuses the operator's own already-authenticated interactive SSH session and never needs a second credential. |
| **Pull pre-built images from GHCR** | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` already builds and pushes `ghcr.io/<repo>-api`/`-web` on every tag — but its `deploy-staging`/`deploy-production` jobs are literal `echo` stubs, no compose file anywhere uses `image:` (both `api` and `web` are `build:`-only), and consuming a GHCR image from a VPS needs registry credentials staged there too. This is the obvious next integration once `oathpath deploy` exists — a `--from-registry` mode that skips the build step — but it is a second, separable piece of work, not part of v1. |
| **A self-contained per-app nginx + certbot** | A VPS hosting one app today is a VPS hosting a second one within a year. Per-app TLS termination means N certbot renewal timers and N nginx processes contending for port 443, with no coherent answer for "what's already bound there" the moment a second app deploys. The shared proxy owns 443 exactly once. |
| **PostgreSQL inside the app stack** | `base.compose.yml` deliberately ships no Postgres service — bundling one here would make the CLI additionally responsible for its backups, volumes, and version upgrades, none of which this repository does for any other stateful dependency (S3/storage is always external too). External-and-validated keeps deploy's blast radius to the stateless tier. |
| **A hardcoded env-var list in the wizard** | The same drift risk `commands/api.ts`'s "one generic command" design exists to avoid — a fork that edits `.env.example` would silently desync from a wizard that doesn't read it. Parsing the file at run time is the only shape that survives a fork's own edits. |
| **A single 34-field TUI form** | Most installs only ever touch the same dozen fields (domain, DB credentials, Google OAuth, admin email); stepping through all 34 including `UPTRACE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` on every single install is exactly the kind of form an operator abandons partway through. The essential-subset-plus-`--all` split targets the common path while keeping the full set one flag away. |

## 17. Suggested phasing (non-binding)

Not the actual issue list — the epic owns that — but a grouping that keeps
each piece reviewable on its own and roughly matches the module boundaries
above, for whoever slices this into the 17 child issues:

1. Phase 0 fixes (section 2) — no CLI code, must land first.
2. Foundations: `executor.ts`, `journal.ts`, `state.ts`, `hooks.ts`, the
   `PRECONDITION` exit code, the three new `prompt.ts` primitives.
3. `repo.ts` + `checks/` + `doctor.ts`.
4. `env-spec.ts` + `env-metadata.ts` + `env-wizard.ts`.
5. `proxy.ts`, including the shared-proxy bootstrap.
6. `health.ts` + `steps/` + `install.ts` end to end.
7. `update.ts`.
8. `status.ts`.
9. `commands/deploy.ts` (stderr rendering for all four subcommands).
10. `tui/screens/deploy.tsx` + the route/menu wiring, including
    `ScrollBox`'s `followTail`.
11. `infra/compose/vps.compose.yml` + this document's own follow-up: once
    real usage exists, fold anything this design got wrong back into it.
